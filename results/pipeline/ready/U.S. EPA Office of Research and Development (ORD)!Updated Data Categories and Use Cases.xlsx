",Monitoring the infiltration rate of tree boxes,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Tree boxes primarily reduce runoff volume through infiltration. The current study determines infiltration rates in six tree boxes and analyzes the effects of season, age of the tree box, and depth on infiltration. Our study site is in Louisville, KY, where Louisville and Jefferson County Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) teamed with U.S. EPA's Office of Research and Development, URS Corporation, and the Center for Infrastructure Research at the University of Louisville (U of L) to monitor the performance of six tree boxes and other stormwater control measures (SCMs) and to evaluate the effectiveness of groups of controls. Each tree box is 1.5 m wide, 1.5 m long, and 1.8 m deep. Street and parking lot runoff enters each tree box though a curb cut. Time domain reflectometers (TDRs) were embedded in the tree box media to continuously monitor volumetric soil moisture content and other parameters. TDRs were installed at 0.30 m (designated as TDR2), 0.60 m (designated as TDR3), and 1.50 m (designated as TDR4) below the soil surface of the tree box media. The moisture content recorded by the TDRs was used to calculate infiltration rates through the media using the Green-Ampt equation. Infiltration rates through the 0.30 m soil section between TDR2 and TDR3 (termed as upper section), through the 0.90 m soil section between TDR3 and TDR4 (termed as bottom section), and the infiltration rate through 1.20 m soil section between TDR2 and TDR4 (termed as combined section) were calculated. For each rain event, two infiltration rates were calculated. The first determined the initial infiltration rate based on infiltrating water and the second calculated the saturated infiltration rate based on draining water. Initial and saturated infiltration rates varied among all six tree boxes. For four of the six tree boxes, the initial infiltration rate did not vary with depth. However, the saturated infiltration rate varied with depth for five of the six tree boxes. Overall, the saturated infiltration rate of the combined section is 1.7 times larger than the upper section. Studies from other researchers reported 8 and 100 times variation of surface infiltration rate within 2 m and 5 m spatial distance respectively, 1.7 times variation between upper and combined sections should be considered a non-meaningful difference. In the second year, the initial infiltration rate and saturated infiltration rate decreased by 20% and 38% respectively, from the first year. The infiltration rate varies with seasons. In the growing season, it is 80% larger than in the non-growing season. The smallest infiltration rates were observed during winter and largest infiltration rates were observed in summer. This paper highlights the continuous two years' soil moisture monitoring results used to characterize the seasonal, age and depth effect on infiltration rate of six tree boxes.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Ahmed, F., and M.

The first tier of tests is intended to detect the potential for endocrine disruption mediated through estrogen, androgen or thyroid pathways, while the second tier is intended to further characterize the effects on these pathways and to establish a dose-response relationship for adverse effects. One of these Tier 2 tests, the Medaka Extended One Generation Reproduction Test (MEOGRT) was developed by the USEPA for the EDSP and, in collaboration with the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals.

",Advancing the Adverse Outcome Pathway Concept - An International 'Horizon Scanning' Approach,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Our ability to conduct whole organism toxicity tests to understand chemical safety has been outpaced by our ability to synthesize new chemicals for a wide variety of commercial applications. Therefore, to increase efficiencies in chemical risk assessment, scientists and risk assessors are turning to mechanistic-based studies, making greater use of in vitro and in silico methods, to evaluate potential environmental and human health hazards. A framework that has gained traction for capturing available knowledge describing the linkage between mechanistic data and the apical toxicity endpoints, required for regulatory assessments, is the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). A number of international activities have focused on AOP development and plausible applications to regulatory decision-making. These interactions have prompted dialog between research scientists and regulatory communities to consider how best to use the AOP framework in risk assessment. While expert-facilitated discussions have been instrumental in moving the science of AOPs forward, it was recognized that a survey of the broader scientific community would aid in identifying current limitations while guiding future initiatives for the AOP framework. To that end, a global 'Horizon Scanning' exercise was conducted to solicit questions concerning the challenges or limitations that must be addressed to realize the full potential of the AOP framework in research and regulatory decision making. The majority of questions received fell into several broad topical areas including the concepts of AOP networks and quantitative AOPs, collaboration on and communication of AOP knowledge, AOP discovery and development, chemical and cross-species extrapolation, exposure considerations, and AOP applications. An expert ranking exercise was then conducted to identify the most important questions for each category. These questions were used to develop four broad themes to inform and guide future AOP research and regulatory initiatives. In addition, frequently asked questions (FAQs) were identified and addressed by experts in the field. Answers to FAQs will aid in framing further discussions about common misperceptions about AOPs and allow for clarification of AOP topics. The need for clarification occurred with surprising frequency, indicating that improvements are needed in communicating the AOP framework among the scientific and regulatory communities. Overall, the 'Horizon Scanning' effort brought together the global scientific community to guide the direction of future initiatives and identify key questions surrounding the AOP framework.

",An Integrated Approach for Identifying Priority Contaminant in the Great Lakes Basin -Investigations in the Lower Green Bay/Fox River and Milwaukee Estuary Areas of Concern,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Prioritization of chemicals was performed on two Areas of Concerns in the Great Lakes An integrated risk surveillance and monitoring approach was applied Bio-effect prediction methodologies were used to identify additional biological pathways.Environmental assessment of complex mixtures typically requires integration of chemical and biological measurements. This study demonstrates the use of a combination of instrumental chemical analyses, effects-based monitoring, and bio-effects prediction approaches to help identify potential hazards and priority contaminants in two Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs), the Lower Green Bay/Fox River located near Green Bay, WI, USA and the Milwaukee Estuary, located near Milwaukee, WI, USA. Fathead minnows were caged at four sites within each AOC (eight sites total). Following 4 d of in situ exposure, tissues and biofluids were sampled and used for targeted biological effects analyses. Additionally, 4 d composite water samples were collected concurrently at each caged fish site and analyzed for 132 analytes as well as evaluated for total estrogenic and androgenic activity using cell-based bioassays. Of the analytes examined, 75 were detected in composite samples from at least one site. Based on multiple analyses, one site in the East River and another site near a paper mill discharge in the Lower Green Bay/Fox River AOC, were prioritized due to their estrogenic and androgenic activity, respectively. The water samples from other sites generally did not exhibit significant estrogenic or androgenic activity, nor was there evidence for endocrine disruption in the fish exposed at these sites as indicated by the lack of alterations in ex vivo steroid production, circulating steroid concentrations, or vitellogenin mRNA expression in males. Induction of hepatic cyp1a mRNA expression was detected at several sites, suggesting the presence of chemicals that activate the Ah receptor. To expand the scope beyond targeted investigation of endpoints selected a priori, several bio-effects prediction approaches were employed to identify other potentially disturbed biological pathways and related chemical constituents that may warrant future monitoring at these sites. For example, several chemicals such as diethylphthalate and naphthalene , and genes and related pathways, such as cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 (CHRM3), estrogen receptor alpha1 (esr1), chemokine ligand 10 protein (CXCL10), tumor protein p53 (p53), and monoamine oxidase B (Maob), were identified as candidates for future assessments at these AOCs. Overall, this study demonstrates that a better prioritization of contaminants and associated hazards can be achieved through integrated evaluation of multiple lines of evidence. Such prioritization can guide more comprehensive follow-up risk assessment efforts.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Li, S., D. Villeneuve, J. Berninger, B. Blackwell, J.

",Ozonolysis of a/b-farnesene mixture: analysis of gas-phase and particulate reaction products,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Atmospheric oxidation of sesquiterpenes has been of considerable interest recently because of their likely contribution to ambient organic aerosol, but farnesene oxidation has been reported in only a few studies and with limited data. In the present study, a detailed chemical analysis of the organic fraction of gas and particle phases originating from the ozonolysis of a mixture of a-farnesene and b-farnesene was carried out in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber. More than 80 organic compounds bearing OH functionality were detected for the first time in this system in the gas and particle phases. The major secondary organic aerosol (SOA) components included conjugated a farnesene trienols, hydroxyl carboxylic acid and its corresponding lactones, C3-C7 linear dicarboxylic acids, and hydroxy/carbonyl/carboxylic compounds. Of particular importance was 5,6-dihydroxy-6-methylheptan-2-one (DHMHO), which was detected at high concentration. In the gas phase, the main species identified were trienols and their corresponding epoxides and diepoxides. Proposed reaction schemes are provided for selected compounds. A similar analysis was performed for ambient PM2.5 samples collected during summer 2013 as part of the SOAS to determine farnesene contributions to PM2.5. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis were consistent with the occurrence of several farnesene SOA compounds, indicating the potential impact of farnesene on the regional aerosol burden. The high abundance of DHMHO in chamber SOA and its presence in ambient PM2.5 is particularly important because to our knowledge it is specific to farnesene and therefore could serve as an indicator for farnesene emitted into ambient aerosol. In the absence of authentic standards, however, it is difficult to accurately quantify the contribution of SOA originating from farnesene to ambient PM2.5.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Jaoui, M., M.

",Detection and Quantification of Silver Nanoparticles at Environmentally Relevant Concentrations Using Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation Online with Single Particle Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The presence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in aquatic environments could potentially cause adverse impacts on ecosystems and human health. However, current understanding of the environmental fate and transport of AgNPs is still limited because their properties in complex environmental samples cannot be accurately determined. In this study, the feasibility of using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) connected online with single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICPMS) to detect and quantify AgNPs at environmentally relevant concentrations was investigated. The AF4 channel had a thickness of 350 um and its accumulation wall was a 10 kDa regenerated cellulose membrane. A 0.02 % FL-70 surfactant solution was used as an AF4 carrier. With 1.2 mL/min AF4 cross flow rate, 1.5 mL/min AF4 channel flow rate, and 5 ms spICPMS dwell time, the AF4-spICPMS can detect and quantify 40 - 80 nm AgNPs, as well as Ag-SiO2 nanoparticles (51.0 nm diameter Ag core and 21.6 nm SiO2 shell), with good recovery within 30 min. This system was not only effective in differentiating and quantifying different types of AgNPs with similar hydrodynamic diameters, such as in mixtures containing Ag-SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles and 40 - 80 nm AgNPs, but also suitable for differentiating between 40 nm AgNPs and elevated dissolved Ag content. The study results indicate that AF4-spICPMS is capable of detecting and quantifying AgNPs and other engineered metal- nanomaterials in environmental samples. Nevertheless, further studies are needed before AF4-spICPMS can become a routine analytical technique.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Huynh, K.A., E. Siska, E. Heithmar, S.

",An Integrated Approach for Identifying Priority Contaminant in the Great Lakes Basin -Investigations in the Lower Green Bay/Fox River and Milwaukee Estuary Areas of Concern,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Prioritization of chemicals was performed on two Areas of Concerns in the Great Lakes An integrated risk surveillance and monitoring approach was applied Bio-effect prediction methodologies were used to identify additional biological pathways.Environmental assessment of complex mixtures typically requires integration of chemical and biological measurements. This study demonstrates the use of a combination of instrumental chemical analyses, effects-based monitoring, and bio-effects prediction approaches to help identify potential hazards and priority contaminants in two Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs), the Lower Green Bay/Fox River located near Green Bay, WI, USA and the Milwaukee Estuary, located near Milwaukee, WI, USA. Fathead minnows were caged at four sites within each AOC (eight sites total). Following 4 d of in situ exposure, tissues and biofluids were sampled and used for targeted biological effects analyses. Additionally, 4 d composite water samples were collected concurrently at each caged fish site and analyzed for 132 analytes as well as evaluated for total estrogenic and androgenic activity using cell-based bioassays. Of the analytes examined, 75 were detected in composite samples from at least one site. Based on multiple analyses, one site in the East River and another site near a paper mill discharge in the Lower Green Bay/Fox River AOC, were prioritized due to their estrogenic and androgenic activity, respectively. The water samples from other sites generally did not exhibit significant estrogenic or androgenic activity, nor was there evidence for endocrine disruption in the fish exposed at these sites as indicated by the lack of alterations in ex vivo steroid production, circulating steroid concentrations, or vitellogenin mRNA expression in males. Induction of hepatic cyp1a mRNA expression was detected at several sites, suggesting the presence of chemicals that activate the Ah receptor. To expand the scope beyond targeted investigation of endpoints selected a priori, several bio-effects prediction approaches were employed to identify other potentially disturbed biological pathways and related chemical constituents that may warrant future monitoring at these sites. For example, several chemicals such as diethylphthalate and naphthalene , and genes and related pathways, such as cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 (CHRM3), estrogen receptor alpha1 (esr1), chemokine ligand 10 protein (CXCL10), tumor protein p53 (p53), and monoamine oxidase B (Maob), were identified as candidates for future assessments at these AOCs. Overall, this study demonstrates that a better prioritization of contaminants and associated hazards can be achieved through integrated evaluation of multiple lines of evidence. Such prioritization can guide more comprehensive follow-up risk assessment efforts.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Li, S., D. Villeneuve, J. Berninger, B. Blackwell, J.

",Ozonolysis of a/b-farnesene mixture: analysis of gas-phase and particulate reaction products,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Atmospheric oxidation of sesquiterpenes has been of considerable interest recently because of their likely contribution to ambient organic aerosol, but farnesene oxidation has been reported in only a few studies and with limited data. In the present study, a detailed chemical analysis of the organic fraction of gas and particle phases originating from the ozonolysis of a mixture of a-farnesene and b-farnesene was carried out in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber. More than 80 organic compounds bearing OH functionality were detected for the first time in this system in the gas and particle phases. The major secondary organic aerosol (SOA) components included conjugated a farnesene trienols, hydroxyl carboxylic acid and its corresponding lactones, C3-C7 linear dicarboxylic acids, and hydroxy/carbonyl/carboxylic compounds. Of particular importance was 5,6-dihydroxy-6-methylheptan-2-one (DHMHO), which was detected at high concentration. In the gas phase, the main species identified were trienols and their corresponding epoxides and diepoxides. Proposed reaction schemes are provided for selected compounds. A similar analysis was performed for ambient PM2.5 samples collected during summer 2013 as part of the SOAS to determine farnesene contributions to PM2.5. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis were consistent with the occurrence of several farnesene SOA compounds, indicating the potential impact of farnesene on the regional aerosol burden. The high abundance of DHMHO in chamber SOA and its presence in ambient PM2.5 is particularly important because to our knowledge it is specific to farnesene and therefore could serve as an indicator for farnesene emitted into ambient aerosol. In the absence of authentic standards, however, it is difficult to accurately quantify the contribution of SOA originating from farnesene to ambient PM2.5.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Jaoui, M., M.

",Detection and Quantification of Silver Nanoparticles at Environmentally Relevant Concentrations Using Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation Online with Single Particle Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The presence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in aquatic environments could potentially cause adverse impacts on ecosystems and human health. However, current understanding of the environmental fate and transport of AgNPs is still limited because their properties in complex environmental samples cannot be accurately determined. In this study, the feasibility of using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) connected online with single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICPMS) to detect and quantify AgNPs at environmentally relevant concentrations was investigated. The AF4 channel had a thickness of 350 um and its accumulation wall was a 10 kDa regenerated cellulose membrane. A 0.02 % FL-70 surfactant solution was used as an AF4 carrier. With 1.2 mL/min AF4 cross flow rate, 1.5 mL/min AF4 channel flow rate, and 5 ms spICPMS dwell time, the AF4-spICPMS can detect and quantify 40 - 80 nm AgNPs, as well as Ag-SiO2 nanoparticles (51.0 nm diameter Ag core and 21.6 nm SiO2 shell), with good recovery within 30 min. This system was not only effective in differentiating and quantifying different types of AgNPs with similar hydrodynamic diameters, such as in mixtures containing Ag-SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles and 40 - 80 nm AgNPs, but also suitable for differentiating between 40 nm AgNPs and elevated dissolved Ag content. The study results indicate that AF4-spICPMS is capable of detecting and quantifying AgNPs and other engineered metal- nanomaterials in environmental samples. Nevertheless, further studies are needed before AF4-spICPMS can become a routine analytical technique.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Huynh, K.A., E. Siska, E. Heithmar, S.

",The Structure and Composition of Puerto Rico's Urban Mangroves MetaData,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Mangrove forests face heightened pressure from human development, which may directly replace these ecosystems or indirectly influence their structure and composition through a variety of anthropogenic activities. As a result, surrounding human communities receive lower overall ecosystem services from the remaining forests, which have been valued among the highest in the world and include fisheries habitat support, shoreline protection and stabilization from natural disasters, and water filtration. Although urban mangrove forests have been characterized as distinct in composition and structure in comparison with their non-urban counterparts, previous studies lack quantified representations of urbanness as well as any inclusion of hydrology or water chemistry, which are important influences on mangrove forest structure, composition, and function. This study uses ground-based and LiDAR measurements of mangroves across urban gradients in Puerto Rico to characterize forest composition and structure. It then tests for the relative importance of urbanization alongside flooding metrics and surface water chemistry in explaining observed variability in forest structure and composition. This data set includes all data and R scripts used in the analysis of Puerto Rico's urban mangroves. Data sets include individual tree species identification and diameter measurements as well as biomass.

",Asian longhorned beetle complicates the relationship between taxonomic diversity and pest vulnerability in street tree assemblages,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Urban foresters routinely emphasise the importance of taxonomic diversity to reduce the vulnerability of tree assemblages to invasive pests, but it is unclear to what extent diversity reduces vulnerability to polyphagous (i.e. generalist) pests. Drawing on field data from seven communities in metropolitan Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, we tested the hypothesis that communities with higher diversity would exhibit lower vulnerability to the polyphagous Asian longhorned beetle, which currently threatens the region. Based on street tree compositions and the beetle's host preferences, Asian longhorned beetle threatened up to 35.6% of individual street trees and 47.5% of the total basal area across the study area, but we did not see clear connections between taxonomic diversity and beetle vulnerability among study communities. For example, the city of Fairfield was among the least diverse communities but had the lowest proportion of trees vulnerable to Asian longhorned beetle, whereas the city of Wyoming exhibited high diversity and high vulnerability. On the other hand, Forest Park aligned with our original hypothesis, as it was characterised by low diversity and high vulnerability. Our results demonstrate that relatively high taxonomic diversity in street tree assemblages does not necessarily lead to reduced vulnerability to a polyphagous pest. Considering the threats posed by polyphagous pests, selecting a set of relatively pest resistant trees known to perform well in urban areas may promote long-term stability better than following simple heuristics for maximising taxonomic diversity, but further study is warranted.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Berland , A., and M.

The aggregate data is hypothesized in the published paper to represent the overall health of both watersheds with respect to various potential water quality impairments. The time series data for each of the individual water quality parameters were used to compute corresponding risk measures (Rel, Res, and Vul) that are reported in Table 4 and 5. The aggregation of the risk measures, which is computed from the aggregate time series and water quality standards in Table 1, is also reported in Table 4 and 5 of the published paper.

Specifically, fathead minnow embryos were exposed to the environmentally-relevant estrogen receptor agonist, estrone, and the data show that: (1) the estrogen-responsive gene transcripts esr1, vtg, and cyp19b can be up-regulated in very early-lifestages of the fathead minnow, (2) WISH methods developed for zebrafish can also be applied successfully to fathead minnows, and (3) WISH has potential to be a useful tool for toxicological studies pertaining to early-lifestage development in the fathead minnow.

",Impact of water quality on chlorine demand of corroding copper (Supplement),U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Copper is widely used in drinking water premise plumbing system materials. In buildings such as hospitals, large and complicated plumbing networks make it difficult to maintain good water quality. Sustaining safe disinfectant residuals throughout a building to protect against waterborne pathogens such as Legionella is particularly challenging since copper and other reactive distribution system materials can exert considerable demands. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of pH and orthophosphate on the consumption of free chlorine associated with corroding copper pipes over time. A copper test-loop pilot system was used to control test conditions and systematically meet the study objectives. Chlorine consumption trends attributed to abiotic reactions with copper over time were different for each pH condition tested, and the total amount of chlorine consumed over the test runs increased with increasing pH. Orthophosphate eliminated chlorine consumption trends with elapsed time (i.e., chlorine demand was consistent across entire test runs). Orthophosphate also greatly reduced the total amount of chlorine consumed over the test runs. Interestingly, the total amount of chlorine consumed and the consumption rate were not pH dependent when orthophosphate was present. The findings reflect the complex and competing reactions at the copper pipe wall including corrosion, oxidation of Cu(I) minerals and ions, and possible oxidation of Cu(II) minerals, and the change in chlorine species all as a function of pH. The work has practical applications for maintaining chlorine residuals in premise plumbing drinking water systems including large buildings such as hospitals.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Lytle , D., and J.

Although ammonia in water does not pose a direct health concern, ammonia nitrification can cause a number of issues and reduce the effectiveness of some treatment processes. An innovative biological ammonia-removal drinking water treatment process was developed and, after the success of a pilot study, a full-scale treatment system using the process was built in a small Iowa community. The treatment plant included a unique aeration contactor design that is able to consistently reduce ammonia from 3.3 mg of nitrogen/L to nearly nondetectable after a biofilm acclimation period. Close system monitoring was performed to avoid excess nitrite release during acclimation, and phosphate was added to enhance biological activity on the basis of pilot study findings. The treatment system is robust, reliable, and relatively simple to operate. The operations and effectiveness of the treatment plant were documented in the study.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Lytle , D., D. Williams , C. Muhlen , M. Pham , K.

",Chemical Transport Model Simulations of Organic Aerosol in Southern California: Model Evaluation and Gasoline and Diesel Source Contributions,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Gasoline- and diesel-fueled engines are ubiquitous sources of air pollution in urban environments. They emit both primary particulate matter and precursor gases that react to form secondary particulate matter in the atmosphere. In this work, we use experimentally derived inputs and parameterizations to predict concentrations and properties of organic aerosol (OA) from mobile sources in southern California using a three-dimensional chemical transport model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ). The updated model includes secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from unspeciated intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOC). Compared to the treatment of OA in the traditional version of CMAQ, which is commonly used for regulatory applications, the updated model did not significantly alter the predicted OA mass concentrations but it did substantially improve predictions of OA sources and composition (e.g., POA-SOA split), and ambient IVOC concentrations. The updated model, despite substantial differences in emissions and chemistry, performs similar to a recently released research version of CMAQ. Mobile sources are predicted to contribute about 30-40 % of the OA in southern California (half of which is SOA), making mobile sources the single largest source contributor to OA in southern California. The remainder of the OA is attributed to non-mobile anthropogenic sources (e.g., cooking, biomass burning) with biogenic sources contributing less than 5 % to the total OA. Gasoline sources are predicted to contribute about thirteen times more OA than diesel sources, this difference is driven by differences in SOA production. Model predictions highlight the need to better constrain multi-generational oxidation reactions in chemical transport models.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Jathar, S., M.

","Association between adverse cardiovascular outcomes and PM2.5 data obtained from monitors, CMAQ models, and satellite models.",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Background: Adverse cardiovascular events have been linked with PM2.5 exposure obtained primarily from air quality monitors, which rarely co-locate with participant residences. Modeled PM2.5 predictions at finer resolution may more accurately predict residential exposure, however few studies have compared results across different exposure assessment methods. Methods: We utilized a cohort of 5679 patients who had undergone a cardiac catheterization between 2002-2009 and resided in NC. Exposure to PM2.5 for the year prior to catheterization was estimated using data from air quality monitors (AQS), Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) fused models at the census tract and 12 km spatial resolutions, and satellite-based models at 10 km and 1 km resolutions. Case status was either a coronary artery disease (CAD) index>23 or a recent myocardial infarction (MI). Logistic regression was used to model odds of having CAD or an MI with each 1-unit (mg/m3) increase in PM2.5, adjusting for sex, race, smoking status, socioeconomic status, and urban/rural status. Results: We found that the elevated odds for CAD>23 and MI were nearly equivalent for all exposure assessment methods. One difference was that data from AQS and the census tract CMAQ showed a rural/urban difference in relative risk, which was not apparent with the satellite or 12 km-CMAQ models. Conclusions: Long-term air pollution exposure was associated with coronary artery disease for both modeled and monitored data.

Virus concentrations for the molecular assay are calculated in terms of genomic copies of viral RNA per liter based upon a standard curve. The method uses a number of quality controls to increase data quality and to reduce interlaboratory and intralaboratory variation. The method has been evaluated by examining virus recovery from ground and reagent grade waters seeded with poliovirus type 3 and murine norovirus as a surrogate for human noroviruses. Mean poliovirus recoveries were 20% in groundwaters and 44% in reagent grade water.

","Impaired swim bladder inflation in early-life stage fathead minnows exposed to a deiodinase inhibitor, iopanoic acid",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The present study investigated whether inhibition of deiodinase, the enzyme which converts thyroxine (T4) to the more biologically-active form, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), would impact inflation of the posterior and/or anterior chamber of the swim bladder, processes previously demonstrated to be thyroid-hormone regulated. Two experiments were conducted using a model deiodinase inhibitor, iopanoic acid (IOP). In the first study, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos were exposed to 0.6, 1.9, or 6.0 mg IOP/L or control water in a flow-through system until reaching 6 days post-fertilization (dpf) at which time posterior swim bladder inflation was assessed. To examine effects on anterior swim bladder inflation, a second study was conducted with 6 dpf larvae exposed to the same IOP concentrations until reaching 21 dpf. Fish from both studies were sampled for T4/T3 measurements, gene transcription analyses, and thyroid histopathology. In the embryo study, incidence and length of inflated posterior swim bladders were significantly reduced in the 6.0 mg/L treatment at 6 dpf. Incidence of inflation and length of anterior swim bladder in larval fish were significantly reduced in all IOP treatments at 14 dpf, but inflation recovered by 18 dpf. Throughout the larval study, whole body T4 concentrations were significantly increased and T3 concentrations were significantly decreased in all IOP treatments. Consistent with hypothesized compensatory responses, significant up-regulation of deiodinase-2 mRNA was observed in the larval study, and down-regulation of thyroperoxidase mRNA was observed in all IOP treatments in both studies. Taken together, these results support the hypothesized adverse outcome pathways linking inhibition of deiodinase activity to impaired swim bladder inflation.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Cavallin, J., G.

",Data for human cell spheroid model of embryonic tissue fusion in vitro.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions drive embryonic fusion events during development and upon perturbation can result in birth defects. Cleft palate and neural tube defects can result from genetic defects or environmental exposures during development, yet very little is known about the effect of chemical exposures on fusion defects in humans because of the lack of relevant and robust human in vitro assays of developmental fusion behavior. Given the etiology and prevalence of cleft palate and the relatively simple architecture and composition of the embryonic palate, we sought to develop a three-dimensional culture system that could be used to study fusion behavior in vitro using human cells. We engineered human Wharton's Jelly stromal cell (HWJSC) spheroids of defined size and established that 7 days of culture in osteogenesis differentiation medium was sufficient to promote an osteogenic phenotype consistent with embryonic palatal mesenchyme. HWJSC spheroids supported the attachment of human epidermal keratinocyte progenitor cells on the outer spheroid surface likely through deposition of collagens I and IV, fibronectin, and laminin, and co-cultured spheroids exhibited fusion behavior that was dependent on epidermal growth factor signaling and fibroblast growth factor signaling in agreement with palate fusion literature. The method described here may broadly apply to the generation of three-dimensional epithelial-mesenchymal co-cultures to study developmental fusion events in a format that is amenable to predictive toxicology applications.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Belair, D., C.

",Doc Title: Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis is Impaired by Transient Developmental Thyroid Hormone Disruption,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Severe thyroid hormone (TH) deprivation during development impairs neurogenesis throughout the brain. The hippocampus also maintains a capacity for neurogenesis throughout life which is reduced in adult-onset hypothyroidism. This study examined hippocampal volume in the neonate and adult hippocampal neurogenesis after developmental and adult-onset TH insufficiency. Pregnant rat dams were administered 0, 3, or 10 ppm of propylthiouracil (PTU) via drinking water from gestational day (GD) 6 until weaning. PTU at the high dose reduced body, brain, hippocampal weights on postnatal day (PN) 14, 21 and 78. Sub-regional analysis revealed decrements in hippocampal volumes at 10 but not 3 ppm PTU on PN23. In Experiment 2, one pair of adult male offspring of 0 and 3ppm-teated dams was placed on 3 ppm PTU from PN60, while a 2nd pair remained on control water. Adult neurogenesis was assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 50mg/kg, ip, 2X daily, X5 days) starting on PN90. Brains from animals perfused 1 and 28 days later were processed for immunohistochemistry. Although no volume changes were seen in neonates at 3ppm, thinning of the granule cell layer emerged in adulthood. Developmental TH insufficiency reduced BrdU+ve cells at 1-day with no further reduction at 28-days post-BrdU, indicative of a selective effect on cell proliferation. This was supported by fewer cells staining for the proliferative marker, Ki67. Adult only PTU did not impair neurogenesis or exacerbate effects seen with developmental exposure. A reduced capacity for neurogenesis may contribute to cognitive deficits evident in adults following moderate degrees of developmental TH insufficiency.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Gilbert, M., J.

",Quantitative Adverse Outcome Pathway for Neurodevelopmental Effects of Thyroid Peroxidase-Induced Thyroid Hormone Synthesis Inhibition,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Adequate levels of thyroid hormones (TH) are needed for proper brain development, deficiencies may lead to adverse neurological outcomes in humans and animal models. Environmental chemicals have been linked to TH disruption, yet the relationship between developmental exposures and decline in serum TH resulting in neurodevelopmental impairment is poorly understood. The present study developed a quantitative adverse outcome pathway (qAOP) where serum thyroxin (T4) reduction following inhibition of thyroperoxidase in the thyroid gland are described and related to deficits in fetal brain TH and the development of a brain malformation, subcortical band heterotopia. Pregnant dams were exposed to 6-propylthiouracil (PTU 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 ppm) from gestational day 6-20, increasing PTU concentrations in maternal thyroid gland and serum as well as in fetal serum. Dams exposed to 0.5 ppm PTU and higher exhibited dose-dependent decreases in thyroidal T4. Serum T4 levels in the dam were significantly decreased with exposure to 2 and 3 ppm PTU. In the fetus, T4 decrements were first observed at a lower dose of 0.5 ppm PTU. Based on these data, fetal brain T4 levels were estimated from published literature sources, and quantitatively linked to increases in the size of the heterotopia present in the brains of offspring. These data show the potential of in vivo assessments and computational descriptions of biological responses to predict the development of this structural brain malformation and use of qAOP approach to evaluate brain deficits that may result from exposure to other TH disruptors.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Hassan, I., H.

",ACTIVE VERSUS SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE FROM WEANING TO ADULTHOOD AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO OZONE IN RATS,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The prevalence of a sedentary (SED) life style combined with calorically rich diets has spurred the rise in childhood obesity which, in turn, translates to adverse health effects in adulthood. Obesity and lack of active (ACT) lifestyle may increase susceptibility to air pollutants. We housed 22 day-old female Long-Evans rats in a cage without (SED) or with a running wheel (ACT). After 10 weeks the rats ran 310 +- 16.3 km (SEM). Responses of SED and ACT rats to whole-body O3 (0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 ppm, 5 hr/day for 2 days) was assessed. Glucose tolerance (GTT) was performed following the first day of O3. ACT rats had less body fat and an improved glucose tolerance (GTT). Ventilatory function (plethysmography) of SED and ACT groups was similarly impaired by O3. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected after the second O3 exposure. SED and ACT rats were hyperglycemic following 1.0 ppm O3. GTT was impaired by O3 in both groups, however, ACT rats exhibited improved recovery to 0.25 and 1.0 ppm O3. BALF cell neutrophils and total cells were similarly increased in ACT and SED groups exposed to 1.0 ppm O3. O3-induced increase in eosinophils was exacerbated in SED rats. Chronic exercise from post-weaning to adulthood improved some of the metabolic and pulmonary responses to O3 (GTT and eosinophils) but several other parameters were unaffected. The reduction in O3-induced rise in BALF eosinophils in ACT rats suggests a possible link between a SED lifestyle and incidence of asthma-related symptoms from O3.  .This dataset is associated with the following publication: Gordon, C., P.

",A DEVICE THAT ALLOWS RODENTS TO BEHAVIORALLY THERMOREGULATE WHEN HOUSED IN VIVARIUMS - DATA,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Laboratories and vivariums are maintained at ambient temperatures (Ta) of 20-24 0C and it is widely accepted that mice maintained under these conditions are cold stressed. When mice are inactive and sleeping in the daytime, their zone of thermoneutrality associated with a basal metabolic rate is 30-32 0C. If given a choice, mice will use thermoregulatory behavior to seek out thermoneutral temperatures during the daytime. The cold stress of a vivarium can be problematic to researchers requiring an animal model that is not stressed metabolically. However, it may not be practical or economically feasible to maintain an animal vivarium at thermoneutral temperatures. One problem with raising the Ta of a vivarium is that personnel wearing protective equipment will be subject to considerable heat stress. In this paper, we present plans for the construction and operation of a device that allows mice to utilize a refuge with a heated floor maintained at an approximate thermoneutral temperatures (30-32 0C). The device is made of inexpensive, readily available materials and utilizes a disposable hand warmer (HotHands(r)) as a heat source. One hand warmer provides a thermoneutral environment for approximately 12 hours. This device is easily adapted to a standard mouse or rat cage and requires brief maintenance each day to change the heating pad. With this device in a standard cage, mice can select an environment associated with thermoneutral conditions during the daytime when inactive and sleeping. At night, the mice are more active, have a higher metabolic rate, and prefer cooler Ta's. Egress from the warmed plate allows mice to seek cooler Ta's at night.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Gordon, C., E. Puckett, E. Repasky, and A. Johnstone.

The long-range goal is to gain sufficient understanding of fish metabolic transformation reactions to be able to accurately predict fish xenobiotic metabolism. While some metabolism data exist, there are few fish in vivo exposure studies where metabolites have been identified and the metabolic pathways proposed. Previous biotransformation work has focused on in vitro studies which have the advantage of high throughput but may have limited metabolic capabilities, and in vivo studies which have full metabolic capacity but are low throughput. An aquatic model system with full metabolic capacity in which a large number of chemicals could be tested would be a valuable tool. The current study evaluated the ex vivo rainbow trout liver slice model, which has the advantages of high throughput as found in vitro models and non-dedifferentiated cells and cell to cell communication found in in vivo systems. The pesticide diazinon, which has been previously tested both in vitro and in vivo in a number of mammalian and aquatic species including rainbow trout, was used to evaluate the ex vivo slice model as a tool to study biotransformation pathways. While somewhat limited by the analytical chemistry method employed, results of the liver slice model, mainly that hydroxypyrimidine was the major diazinon metabolite, are in line with the results of previous rainbow trout in vivo studies. Therefore, the rainbow trout liver slice model is a useful tool for the study of metabolism in aquatic species.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Tapper, M., J. Serrano, P.

These vehicle models allow simulation of energy flows and CO2 emissions for mild hybrid electric vehicles over EPA regulatory drive cycles and during real-world driving. The battery model is a standard equivalent circuit model with two-time constant resistance-capacitance (RC) blocks. Resistances and capacitances were calculated using test data from an 8 Ah, 0.4 kWh, 48 V (nominal) lithium-ion battery obtained from a Tier 1 automotive supplier, A123 Systems, and developed specifically for 48 V MHEV applications. The A123 Systems battery has 14 pouch-type lithium ion cells arranged in a 14 series and 1 parallel (14S1P) configuration. The RC battery model was validated using battery test data generated by a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system that simulated the impact of mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV) operation on the A123 systems 48 V battery pack over U.S. regulatory drive cycles. The HIL system matched charge and discharge data originally generated by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) during chassis dynamometer testing of a 2013 Chevy Malibu Eco 115 V MHEV. All validation testing was performed at the Battery Test Facility (BTF) at the U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The simulated battery voltages, currents, and state of charge (SOC) of the HIL tests were in good agreement with vehicle test data over a number of different drive cycles and excellent agreement was achieved between RC model simulations of the 48 V battery and HIL battery test data.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Lee, S., J.

Male C57Bl/6J mice (n=6/group) were exposed to filtered air (FA), 0.3 ppm acrolein, or 3.0 ppm acrolein for 3 hours in whole body plethysmography chambers. Cardiac strain data, heart function, and transmitral blood flow were investigated with echocardiography (40 MHz) 1 day prior to exposure, 1 hour after exposure, and 1 day after exposure. During the first 30 minutes of exposure, breathing frequency decreased. tidal volume increased, and expiratory/inspiratory time ratio increased in response to 3.0 ppm acrolein. Elapsed time between peak strain in adjacent wall segments (i.e. myocardial strain delay), a measure of myocardial dyssynchrony, increased significantly in mice exposed to 3.0 ppm acrolein at 1 and 24 hours post-exposure. Mice exposed to 0.3 ppm acrolein did not demonstrate changes in myocardial synchrony but did show decreases in myocardial performance, i.e. increased Tei index, at both 1 and 24 hours post-exposure.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Thompson, L., A.

The major SOA components measured include conjugated a farnesene trienols, C3-C7 linear dicarboxylic acids, carbonyl compounds, and hydroxy/carbonyl/carboxylic compounds. In the gas phase, the main species identified were formaldehyde, glyoxal, methylglyoxal, acetone, 2,3-dimethyl-oxirane, 2(3H)-furanone, 2-butenedioic acid, 4 oxopentanal, 4-methylenehex-5-enal, and 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one. Proposed reaction schemes are provided for selected compounds. H-atom abstraction and OH addition in a/b-farnesene oxidation seem to play an important role via the formation of unsaturated radicals containing different numbers of delocalized electrons. Allylic hydrogen abstraction and hydroperoxyalkyl radical channels might play a key role in the oxidation of a/b-farnesene. The contribution of farnesene SOA products to ambient PM2.5 was investigated by analyzing PM2.5 samples collected during SOAS 2013 field study at a site in Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC. The importance of these findings was supported by the occurrence of several organic species in both field and laboratory samples, suggesting the impact of farnesene on the ambient aerosol burden, mainly in areas where farnesene emissions are high. Although, pentanedioic acid and methylsuccinic acid appear to be candidate markers for farnesene SOA, additional chamber and mechanistic studies are required to estimate the contributions of farnesene to ambient SOA.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Jaoui, M., M.

","Characterization of polar organosulfates in secondary organic aerosol from the unsaturated aldehydes 2-E-pentenal, 2-E-hexenal, and 3-Z-hexenal",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"We show in the present study that the unsaturated aldehydes, 2-E-pentenal, 2-E-hexenal and 3-Z-hexenal, are biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) precursors for polar organosulfates with molecular weighs (MWs) 230 and 214, which are also present in ambient fine aerosol from a forested site, i.e., K-puszta, Hungary. These results complement those obtained in a previous study showing that the green leaf aldehyde 3-Z-hexenal serves as a precursor for MW 226 organosulfates. Thus, in addition to isoprene, the green leaf volatiles 2-E-hexenal and 3-Z-hexenal, emitted due to plant stress (mechanical wounding or insect attack), and 2-E-pentenal, a photolysis product of 3-Z-hexenal, should be taken into account for secondary organic aerosol and organosulfate formation. Polar organosulfates are of climatic relevance because of their hydrophilic properties and cloud effects. Extensive use was made of organic mass spectrometry (MS) and detailed interpretation of MS data (i.e., ion trap MS and accurate mass measurements) to elucidate the chemical structures of the MW 230, 214 and 170 organosulfates formed from 2-E-pentenal and indirectly from 2-E-hexenal and 3-Z-hexenal. In addition, quantum chemical calculations were performed to explain the different mass spectral behavior of 2,3-dihydroxypentanoic acid sulfate derivatives, where only the isomer with the sulfate group at C-3 results in the loss of SO3. The MW 214 organosulfates formed from 2-E-pentenal are explained by epoxidation of the double bond in the gas phase and sulfation of the epoxy group with sulfuric acid in the particle phase through the same pathway as that proposed for 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-sulfoxypropanoic acid from the isoprene-related a,b-unsaturated aldehyde methacrolein in previous work (Lin et al., 2013). The MW 230 organosulfates formed from 2-E-pentenal are tentatively explained by a novel pathway, which bears features of the latter pathway but introduces an additional hydroxyl group at the C-4 position. Evidence is also presented that the MW 214 positional isomer, 3hydroxy-2-sulfooxypentanoic acid is unstable and decarboxylates, giving rise to 2-hydroxy-1sulfoxybutane, a MW 170 organosulfate. Furthermore, evidence is obtained that lactic acid sulfate is generated from 2-E-pentenal.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Shalamzari, M., R. Vermeylen, F. Blockhuys, T.

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples were collected in consecutive 12-h day and night increments during spring and fall 2012 sampling campaigns. Sampling sites were strategically located to evaluate conditions in close proximity of a large steel works industrial complex, as well as away from direct influence of the industrial complex. These samples were analyzed for metals and other elements, organic and elemental (black) carbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The PM2.5 samples were supplemented with pollutant gases and meteorological parameters. We applied the EPA PMF v5.1 model with uncertainty estimate features to the Ostrava data set. Using the model's bootstrapping procedure and other considerations, six factors were determined to provide the optimum solution. Each model run consisted of 100 iterations to ensure that the solution represents a global minimum. The resulting factors were identified as representing coal (power plants), mixed Cl, crustal, industrial 1 (alkali metals and PAHs), industrial 2 (transition metals), and home heat/transportation. The home heating source is thought to be largely domestic boilers burning low quality fuels such as lignite, wood, and domestic waste. Transportation-related combustion emissions could not be resolved as a separate factor. Uncertainty estimates support the general conclusion that the factors identified as representing coal power and home heat/transportation dominate the percent contribution to fine mass. Apportionment of regulated individual species is also presented.Two data files are provided to support the dataset. One provides the input data (concentrations and uncertainties) as used in the PMF source apportionment model.

",Multi-laboratory survey of qPCR enterococci analysis method performance in U.S. coastal and inland surface waters,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has become a frequently used technique for quantifying enterococci in recreational surface waters, but there are several methodological options. Here we evaluated how three method permutations, type of mastermix, sample extract dilution and use of controls in results calculation, affect method reliability among multiple laboratories with respect to sample interference. Multiple samples from each of 22 sites representing an array of habitat types were analyzed using EPA Method 1611 and 1609 reagents with full strength and five-fold diluted extracts. The presence of interference was assessed three ways: using sample processing and PCR amplifications controls, consistency of results across extract dilutions, and relative recovery of target genes from spiked enterococci in water sample compared to control matrices with acceptable recovery defined as 50 to 200%. Method 1609, which is based on an environmental mastermix, was found to be superior to Method 1611, which is based on a universal mastermix. Method 1611 had over a 40% control assay failure rate with undiluted extracts and a 6% failure rate with diluted extracts. Method 1609 failed in only 11% and 3% of undiluted and diluted extracts analyses. Use of sample processing control assay results in the delta-delta Ct method for calculating relative target gene recoveries increased the number of acceptable recovery results. Delta-delta tended to bias recoveries from apparent partially inhibitory samples on the high side which could help in avoiding potential underestimates of enterococci - an important consideration in a public health context. Control assay and delta-delta recovery results were largely consistent across the range of habitats sampled, and among laboratories. The methodological option that best balanced acceptable estimated target gene recoveries with method sensitivity and avoidance of underestimated enterococci densities was Method 1609 without extract dilution and using the delta-delta calculation method. The applicability of this method can be extended by the analysis of diluted extracts to sites where interference is indicated but, particularly in these instances, should be confirmed by augmenting the control assays with analyses for target gene recoveries from spiked target organisms.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Haugland , R., S.

Higher average relative humidity in the northeast might promote mold and mite exposures and possibly asthma prevalence. To test this hypothesis, mold contamination, Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) values were measured in floor dust (n = 26) and dust mite allergen concentrations in bed dust (n = 14). For this analysis, the eight HR were divided into those with LCAP > 30% (n = 3) and < 30% (n = 5). The average ERMI value was significantly greater (Wilcoxon Rank Sum, p < 0.001) in high than in low LCAP HR (14.5 vs. 9.3). The dust mite antigens Der p 1, Der f 1, and Blo t 5 were detected in 90% of bed samples, but the concentrations were not significantly different in high vs. low LCAP HR.

In the standard for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents in China and other countries, fecal coliform is the only microbial indicator, raising concerns about the potential for pathogen transmission through WWPT effluent reuse. In this study, we collected 50 effluent samples (30 L/sample) from three municipal WWTPs in Shanghai, China and analyzed for Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia duodenalis and Enterocytozoon bieneusi by microscopy and/or PCR. Moreover, propidium monoazide (PMA)-PCR was used to assess the viability of oocysts/cysts. The microscopy and PCR-positive rates for Cryptosporidium spp. were 62% and 40%, respectively. The occurrence rates of G. duodenalis were 96% by microscopy and 92-100% by PCR analysis of three genetic loci. Furthermore, E. bieneusi was detected in 70% (35/50) of samples by PCR. Altogether, ten Cryptosporidium species or genotypes, two G. duodenalis genotypes, and 11 E. bieneusi genotypes were found, most of which were human-pathogenic. The chlorine dioxide disinfection employed in WWTP1 and WWTP3 failed to inactivate the residual pathogens, 93% of the samples from WWTP1 and 83% from WWTP3 did not meet the national standard on fecal coliform levels. Thus, urban WWTP effluents often contain residual waterborne human pathogens.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Ma, J., Y. Feng, Y. Hu, E. Villegas , and L. Xiao.

The height of the mixed layer in the daytime boundary layer can have a strong influence on the concentration of pollutants within this layer. Deflections of streamlines at the height of the interface are primarily a function of hill Froude number (Fr), the ratio of mixed-layer height (zi) to terrain height (h), and the crosswind dimension of the terrain. The magnitude of the deflections increases as Fr increases and zi / h decreases. For mixing-height streamlines that are initially below the terrain top, the response is linear with Fr, for those initially above the terrain feature the response to Fr is more complex. Once Fr exceeds about 2, the terrain-related response of the mixed layer interface decreases somewhat with increasing Fr (toward more neutral flow). Deflections are also shown to increase as the crosswind dimensions of the terrain increases. Comparisons with numerical modeling, limited field data and other laboratory measurements reported in the literature are favorable. Additionally, visual observations of dye streamers suggests that the flow structure exhibited for our elevated inversions passing over three dimensional hills is similar to that reported in the literature for continuously stratified flow over two-dimensional hills.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Perry, S., and W.

Regression modeling performed on measurements of selected pesticides in composited duplicate diet samples allowed 1) estimation of pesticide intakes for a defined demographic community, and 2) comparison of dietary pesticide intakes between the composite and individual samples. Extant databases were useful for assigning individual samples to composites, but they could not provide the breadth of information needed to facilitate measurable levels in every composite. Composite sample measurements were found to be good predictors of pyrethroid pesticide levels in their individual sample constituents where sufficient measurements are available above the method detection limit.

Not known, however, is whether maternal exercise can alter these adverse outcomes. In this study, Long-Evans female rats were provided a high fat (60%, HFD) or control diet (CD) 44 days before mating and throughout gestation and lactation. Running wheels were available to half of each diet group during the gestational period only: CD diet with (CDRW) or without (sedentary, CDSED) exercise, and HFD with (HFRW) or without (HFSED) exercise. The offspring in this study were put on control diet after weaning and examined using a number of behavioral evaluations up to 4 months of age. Offspring of CDRW dams weighed less than offspring from CDSED dams, as well as from HFD dams. After weaning, the lower weight in CDRW offspring persisted in male, but not female, rats. Male (females not tested) offspring from HFSED dams performed worse than other groups in a Morris water maze during initial spatial training as well as reversal learning, memory was not impacted. Female, but not male, offspring from the HFSED dams showed less preference for chocolate milk during a 2-bottle choice test. No differences were seen in tests of novel object recognition, social approach, or locomotor activity.

",Comparison of cryopreserved trout hepatocytes and liver S9 fractions as in vitro tools for bioaccumulation assessment of chemicals that undergo biotransformation in fish,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The purpose of this study was to compare two in vitro systems, cryopreserved trout hepatocytes and trout liver S9 fractions, used to predict in vivo levels of biotransformation in fish. This information is needed to refine modeled estimates of bioaccumulation for hydrophobic organic chemicals that undergo biotransformation. In this effort we used trout hepatocytes to measure in vitro biotransformation of 6 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results were compared to metabolism rates reported previously for trout liver S9 fractions. Results obtained using both in vitro systems were then used to predict measured levels of hepatic clearance for the same test chemicals exhibited by isolated perfused livers. The results of this study suggest that both in vitro systems are well suited for performing in vitro-in vivo metabolism extrapolations with fish as a means for improving modeled bioaccumulation predictions.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Fay, K., P.

",Soil organic matter and amphibian exposure dataset.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Dermal uptake from soil is known to occur in amphibians, but predicting pesticide availability and bioconcentration across soil types is not well understood. The present study was designed to compare uptake of 5 current-use pesticides (imidacloprid, atrazine, triadimefon, fipronil, and pendimethalin) in American toads (Bufo americanus) from exposure on soils with significant organic matter content differences (14.1% = high organic matter and 3.1% = low organic matter). We placed toads on high- or low-organic matter soil after applying individual current-use pesticides on the soil surface for an 8-h exposure duration. Whole body tissue homogenates and soils were extracted and analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine pesticide tissue and soil concentration, as well as bioconcentration factor in toads. Tissue concentrations were greater on the low-organic matter soil than the high-organic matter soil across all pesticides (average +- standard error, 1.23 +- 0.35 ppm and 0.78 +- 0.23 ppm, respectively), and bioconcentration was significantly higher for toads on the low-organic matter soil (analysis of covariance p = 0.002). Soil organic matter is known to play a significant role in the mobility of pesticides and bioavailability to living organisms. Agricultural soils typically have relatively lower organic matter content and serve as a functional habitat for amphibians. The potential for pesticide accumulation in amphibians moving throughout agricultural landscapes may be greater and should be considered in conservation and policy efforts.

The parking lot design includes a permeable interlocking concrete pavement section along the downgradient edge. This study monitored the clogging progress of the pavement section using twelve water content reflectometers and three buried tipping bucket rain gauges. This clogging dynamic investigations was divided into three stages namely pre-clogged, transitional, and clogged. Recorded initial relative water content of all three stages were significantly and negatively correlated to antecedent dry weather periods with stronger correlations during clogged conditions. The peak relative water content correlation with peak rainfall 10-min intensity was significant for the water content reflectometers located on the western edge away from the eastern edge, this correlation was strongest during transition stage. Once clogged, rainfall measurements no longer correlated with the buried tipping bucket rain gauges. Both water content reflectometers and buried tipping bucket rain gauges showed the progress of surface clogging. For every 6mm of rain clogging advanced 1 mm across the surface. The results generally support the hypothesis that the clogging progresses from the upgradient to the downgradient edge. The magnitude of the contributing drainage area and rainfall characteristics are effective factors on rate and progression of clogging.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Razzaghmanesh, M., and M.

",2018_extent_CI_data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Full resolution (300m), weekly MERIS data were obtained over the contiguous United States for 2008 through 2011. Seven day composite images were created by retaining the maximum value detected for each pixel within the time period and then the monthly mean of the maximums was calculated. A spatial mosaic composed of 54 individual scenes was generated for each week resulting in a total of 208 CONUS images from 2008 to 2011. Weekly OLCI data were also retrieved from January 2017 through December 2017. MERIS and OLCI data were processed by the NASA OBPG, using the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System, SRTM static land mask, and a transformation to Albers Equal Area with an area-weighted interpolation to match the projections of the National Hydrography Dataset High Resolution. The SRTM land mask and SeaDAS processing is static in relation to waterbody size and did not account for periods of drought nor flood during the study period. Any water pixel adjacent to the SRTM static land mask was automatically flagged and excluded from analysis to reduce potential for mixed land-water pixels and land adjacency effects. To avoid pixel misclassification due to artifacts such as bridges, catchment facilities, and islands, ""valid"" water pixels were determined by examining the ESRI World Imagery Basemap. This manual operator pixel selection process lowered the potential that land pixels were not misclassified as water or vice versa. Each 300m satellite pixel in a weekly CONUS map represents a provisional maximum Cyanobacteria Index (CI) value retrieved in the specific time period. The provisional CI was calculated using a spectral shape (SS) algorithm detailed and validated elsewhere.Conventional methods to distinguish between ice and water often fail due to high ice reflectance as well as the possibility of cyanobacterial biomass formation under the ice. Therefore, weekly MERIS data were masked for the presence of ice and snow using Interative Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) Northern Hemisphere Snow and Ice Analysis data (Version 1, 4km). Daily snow and ice data were obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center then cropped to the extent of CONUS. Snow and ice data were temporally binned into maximum weekly time composites to match the MERIS data and then converted from raster to shapefile format. If MERIS or OLCI CI values were within the spatial area of the snow and ice mask, they were removed from further analysis. NOTE: This dataset has been removed from public access due to revocation.

Fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic killifish) is a non-migratory estuarine fish that exhibits high allelic and phenotypic diversity partitioned among subpopulations that reside in disparate environmental conditions. An ideal candidate model organism for studying gene-environment interactions, the molecular toolbox for F. heteroclitus is limited. We identified hundreds of novel microsatellites which, when combined with existing microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were used to construct the first genetic linkage map for this species. By integrating independent linkage maps from three genetic crosses, we developed a consensus map containing 24 linkage groups, consistent with the number of chromosomes reported for this species. These linkage groups span 2300 centimorgans (cM) of recombinant genomic space, intermediate in size relative to the current linkage maps for the teleosts, medaka and zebrafish. Comparisons between fish genomes support a high degree of synteny between the consensus F. heteroclitus linkage map and the medaka and (to a lesser extent) zebrafish physical genome assemblies.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Waits , E., J.

",Biomarker analysis of liver cells exposed to surfactant-wrapped and oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have great potential in industrial, consumer, and mechanical applications, based partly on their unique structural, optical and electronic properties. CNTs are commonly oxidized or treated with surfactants to facilitate aqueous solution processing, and these CNT surface modifications also increase possible human and ecological exposures to nanoparticle-contaminated waters. To determine the exposure outcomes of oxidized and surfactant-wrapped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on biochemical processes, metabolomics based profiling of human liver cells (C3A) was utilized. Cells were exposed to 0, 10, or 100 ng/mL of MWCNTs for 24 and 48 hr. MWCNT particle size distribution, charge, and aggregation were monitored concurrently during exposures. Following MWCNT exposure, cellular metabolites were extracted, lyophilized, and buffered for 1H NMR analysis. Acquired spectra were subjected to both multivariate and univariate analysis to determine the consequences of nanotube exposure on the metabolite profile of C3A cells. Resulting scores plots illustrated temporal and dose-dependent metabolite responses to all MWCNTs tested. Loadings plots coupled with t-test filtered spectra identified metabolites of interest. XPS analysis revealed the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl functionalities on both MWCNTs surfaces. Metal content analysis by ICP-AES indicated that the total mass concentration of the potentially toxic impurities in the exposure experiments were extremely low (i.e. [Ni] <= 2 x 10-10 g/mL). Preliminary data suggested that MWCNT exposure causes perturbations in biochemical processes involved in cellular oxidation as well as fluxes in amino acid metabolism and fatty acid synthesis. Dose-response trajectories were apparent and spectral peaks related to both dose and MWCNT dispersion methodologies were determined. Correlations of the significant changes in metabolites will help to identify potential biomarkers associated with carbonaceous nanoparticle exposure.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Henderson, M., D.

Corroded iron and cement-mortar lined iron represented the infrastructure surfaces, and were conditioned in a 23 m long, 15 cm diameter (75 ft long, 6 in diameter) pilot-scale drinking water distribution pipe system. Decontamination was evaluated using increased water velocity (flushing) alone at 0.5 m sec-1 (1.7 ft sec-1), as well as free chlorine (5 and 25 mg L-1), monochloramine (25 mg L-1), chlorine dioxide (5 and 25 mg L-1), ozone (2.0 mg L-1), peracetic acid 25 mg L-1) and acidified nitrite (0.1 mol L-1 at pH 2 and 3), all followed by flushing at 0.3 m sec-1 (1 ft sec-1). Flushing alone reduced the adhered spores by 0.5 and 2.0 log10 from iron and cement-mortar, respectively. Log10 reduction on corroded iron pipe wall coupons ranged from 1.0 to 2.9 at respective chlorine dioxide concentrations of 5 and 25 mg L-1, although spores were undetectable on the iron surface during disinfection at 25 mg L-1. Acidified nitrite (pH 2, 0.1 mol L-1) yielded no detectable spores on the iron surface during the flushing phase after disinfection.

",Fine-Tuning ADAS Algorithm Parameters,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"With the development of the Connected Vehicle technology that facilitates wirelessly communication among vehicles and road-side infrastructure, the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can be adopted as an effective tool for accelerating traffic safety and mobility optimization at various highway facilities. To this end, the traffic management centers identify the optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set that enables the maximum improvement of the traffic safety and mobility performance, and broadcast the optimal parameter set wirelessly to individual ADAS-equipped vehicles. After adopting the optimal parameter set, the ADAS-equipped drivers become active agents in the traffic stream that work collectively and consistently to prevent traffic conflicts, lower the intensity of traffic disturbances, and suppress the development of traffic oscillations into heavy traffic jams. Successful implementation of this objective requires the analysis capability of capturing the impact of the ADAS on driving behaviors, and measuring traffic safety and mobility performance under the influence of the ADAS. To address this challenge, this research proposes a synthetic methodology that incorporates the ADAS-affected driving behavior modeling and state-of-the-art microscopic traffic flow modeling into a virtually simulated environment. Building on such an environment, the optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set is identified through an optimization programming framework to enable the maximum safety and mobility improvement. The developed methodology is tested at a freeway facility under both low and high ADAS market penetration rate scenarios. The identified optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set can be used to establish multiple traffic management strategies. These strategies form a pool of candidate plans for the traffic management team to select when they face different control objectives (e.g., safety improvement more important, mobility improvement more important, or balanced safety and mobility improvement). It is also found that the traffic system optimization becomes easier to achieve as the ADAS penetration rate becomes higher.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Liu, H., H. Wei, T. Zuo, Z. Li, and J. Yang. Fine-Tuning ADAS Algorithm Parameters for Optimizing Traffic Safety and Mobility in Connected Vehicle Environment. TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH.

",An approach to measure parameter sensitivity in watershed hydrologic modeling,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Abstract Hydrologic responses vary spatially and temporally according to watershed characteristics. In this study, the hydrologic models that we developed earlier for the Little Miami River (LMR) and Las Vegas Wash (LVW) watersheds were used for detail sensitivity analyses. To compare the relative sensitivities of the hydrologic parameters of these two models, we used Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). By combining the NRMSE index with the flow duration curve analysis, we derived an approach to measure parameter sensitivities under different flow regimes. Results show that the parameters related to groundwater are highly sensitive in the LMR watershed, whereas the LVW watershed is primarily sensitive to near surface and impervious parameters. The high and medium flows are more impacted by most of the parameters. Low flow regime was highly sensitive to groundwater related parameters. Moreover, our approach is found to be useful in facilitating model development and calibration.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Ranatunga, T., S. Tong, and J. Yang.

",Mixing at double-Tee junctions with unequal pipe sizes in water distribution systems,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Pipe flow mixing with various solute concentrations and flow rates at pipe junctions is investigated. The degree of mixing affects the spread of contaminants in a water distribution system. Many studies have been conducted on the mixing at the cross junctions. Yet few have focused on double-Tee junctions of unequal pipe sizes. To investigate the solute mixing at double-Tee junctions with unequal pipe sizes, a series of experiments were conducted in a turbulent regime (Re=12500-50000) with different Reynolds number ratios and connecting pipe lengths. It is found that dimensionless outlet concentrations depended on mixing mechanism at the impinging interface of pipe junctions. Junction with a larger pipe size ratio is associated with more complete mixing. The inlet Reynolds number ratio affects mixing more strongly than the outlet Reynolds number ratio. Furthermore, the dimensionless connecting pipe length in a double-Tee played an important and complicated role in the flow mixing. Based on these results, two-dimensional isopleth maps were developed for the calculation of normalized north outlet concentration.

",A study of temporal effects of the model anti-androgen flutamide on components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in adult fathead minnows,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The aim of this study was to investigate temporal changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis of fathead minnow treated with the model androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, flutamide. Reproductively-mature fish were exposed in a flow-through, measured test to either 50 or 500 ug flutamide/L for 8 d, followed by an 8-d recovery period in clean water. Samples were collected at 1, 2, 4 and 8 days during each phase of the experiment. Flutamide (500 ug/L) caused significant reductions in relative gonad size of the females on days 8 of the exposure and 1 of the recovery, and reduced expression of secondary sex characteristics in males during the exposure phase of the experiment. Ex vivo gonadal synthesis of testosterone in both sexes (and 17b-estradiol in females) was reduced in the 500 ug/L treatment within 2 d of exposure, however, steroid synthesis returned to levels comparable to controls by the end of the exposure portion of the test. Steroid synthesis in males exposed to 50 ug flutamide/L was greater than in controls on days 4 and 8 of the exposure. Both the enhanced steroid production in the low treatment males, and return to control levels in the high treatment males and females during chemical exposure are indicative of a compensatory HPG response. One contributor to this response could be increased expression of genes responsible for enzymes involved in steroid synthesis, for example, transcripts for both cytochrome P450 side- chain cleavage and 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase were significantly elevated in flutamide-exposed males. Overall, responses of the HPG axis in adult male and female fathead minnows exposed to flutamide were both dynamic and comparatively rapid during exposure and recovery. This has ramifications both for the development of short-term fish assays to detect endocrine-active chemicals, and the derivation of robust adverse outcome pathways for AR antagonists in fish.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Milsk, R., J.

To date no studies have examined how contrasting atmospheres with a similar Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), but with differing ratios of criteria air pollutants, might differentially affect health endpoints. Here we produced two atmospheres with similar AQHIs based on the final concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter (PM2.5). One simulated atmosphere (SA-PM) generated from irradiation of ~23 ppmC gasoline, ~5 ppmC of a-pinene, 529 ppb NO, and 3 ug m-3 (NH4)2SO4 as a seed resulted in ~976 ug m-3 PM2.5, 326 ppb NO2, and 141 ppb O3 (AQHI 97.7). The other atmosphere (SA-O3) generated from ~8 ppmC gasoline, 5 ppmC isoprene, 874 ppb NO, 2 ug m-3 (NH4)2SO4 resulted in ~55 ug m-3 PM2.5, 643 ppb NO2, and 430 ppb O3 (AQHI of 99.8). Chemical speciation by gas chromatography showed that photo-oxidation degraded the organic precursors and promoted the de novo formation of secondary reaction products such as formaldehyde and acrolein.

",Data for a PPAR-alpha dependence of developmental effects of PFNA in mouse.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) is one of the perfluoroalkyl acids found in the environment and in tissues of humans and wildlife. Prenatal exposure to PFNA negatively impacts survival and development of mice and activates the mouse and human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARa). In the current study, we used PPARa knockout (KO) and 129S1/SvlmJ wild-type (WT) mice to investigate the role of PPARa in mediating PFNA-induced in vivo effects. Pregnant KO and WT mice were dosed orally with water (vehicle control: 10 ml/kg), 0.83, 1.1, 1.5, or 2mg/kg PFNA on gestational days (GDs) 1-18 (day of sperm plug = GD 0). Maternal weight gain, implantation, litter size, and pup weight at birth were unaffected in either strain. PFNA exposure reduced the number of live pups at birth and survival of offspring to weaning in the 1.1 and 2 mg/kg groups in WT. Eye opening was delayed (mean delay 2.1 days) and pup weight at weaning was reduced inWT pups at 2mg/kg. These developmental endpoints were not affected in the KO. Relative liver weight was increased in a dose-dependent manner in dams and pups of theWT strain at all dose levels but only slightly increased in the highest dose group in the KO strain. In summary, PFNA altered liver weight of dams and pups, pup survival, body weight, and development in the WT, while only inducing a slight increase in relative liver weight of dams and pups at 2mg/kg in KO mice. These results suggest that PPARa is an essential mediator of PFNA-induced developmental toxicity in the mouse.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Abbott, B., C. Wolf, J.

WRF-CMAQ simulations over the continental United State are performed over the 2001 to 2010 time period at two different horizontal resolutions of 12 and 36 km. Both simulations used the same emission inventory and model configurations. Model results are compared both in space and time to assess the potential weaknesses and strengths of using coarse resolution in long-term air quality applications. The results show that the 36 km and 12 km simulations are comparable in terms of trends analysis for both pollutant concentrations and radiation variables. The advantage of using the coarser 36 km resolution is a significant reduction of computational cost, time and storage requirement which are key considerations when performing multiple years of simulations for trend analysis. However, if such simulations are to be used for local air quality analysis, finer horizontal resolution may be beneficial since it can provide information on local gradients. In particular, divergences between the two simulations are noticeable in urban, complex terrain and coastal regions."".This dataset is associated with the following publication: Gan , M., C.

",Evaluation of near surface ozone and particulate matter in air quality simulations driven by dynamically downscaled historical meteorological fields,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This dataset supports the modeling study of Seltzer et al. (2016) published in Atmospheric Environment. In this study, techniques typically used for future air quality projections are applied to a historical 11-year period to assess the performance of the modeling system when the driving meteorological conditions are obtained using dynamical downscaling of coarse-scale fields without correcting toward higher resolution observations. The Weather Research and Forecasting model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality model are used to simulate regional climate and air quality over the contiguous United States for 2000-2010. The air quality simulations for that historical period are then compared to observations from four national networks. Comparisons are drawn between defined performance metrics and other published modeling results for predicted ozone, fine particulate matter, and speciated fine particulate matter. The results indicate that the historical air quality simulations driven by dynamically downscaled meteorology are typically within defined modeling performance benchmarks and are consistent with results from other published modeling studies using finer-resolution meteorology. This indicates that the regional climate and air quality modeling framework utilized here does not introduce substantial bias, which provides confidence in the method's use for future air quality projections.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Seltzer, K., C.

Results show that anterior, but not posterior, swim bladder inflation was impacted by exposure to MBT supporting the development of an AOP linking a specific thyroid-disrupting molecular initiating event to a significant phenotypic outcome. Results also suggest an alternative short-term in vivo test with larval fathead minnows that could be used to screen chemicals for thyroid disrupting activity and possibly distinguish thyroid disrupting modes of action.

The rivers of concern have mean annual discharges ranging from 1.09 to 3240 m3/s. Five existing USEPA models are used to generate the required databases. The Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS) and the High Throughput Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation Model (SHEDS-HT) are used to estimate the pchem properties and loading rates of the chemicals of interest, respectively. Using these data, the dissolved and total water concentrations, and total sediment concentrations for each chemical-loading combination in the rivers of interest are simulated using the Exposure Analysis Modeling System (EXAMS). Lastly, the Kow-based Aquatic BioAccumulation Model (KABAM) and the Bioaccumulation and Aquatic System Simulator (BASS) are used to estimate BCFs of periphyton and phytoplankton and BAFs of benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, and fish in the rivers of interest.

Inactivation by the LEDs was compared with the efficacy of conventional UV sources, the low-pressure (LP) and medium-pressure (MP) mercury vapor lamps. The work also calculated the electrical energy per order of reduction of the microorganisms by the five UV sources.For E. coli, all five UV sources yielded similar inactivation rates. For MS2 coliphage, the 260 nm LED was most effective. For HAdV2 and B. pumilus, the MP UV lamp was significantly more effective than the LP UV and UVC LED sources. When considering electrical energy per order of reduction, the LP UV lamp was the most efficient for E. coli and MS2, and the MPUV and LPUV were equally efficient for HAdV2 and B. pumilus spores. Among the UVC LEDs, the 280 nm LED unit required the least energy per log reduction of E. coli and HAdV2.

",Recreational freshwater fishing drives non-native aquatic species richness patterns at a continental scale,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Aim. Mapping the geographic distribution of non-native aquatic species is a critically important precursor to understanding the anthropogenic and environmental factors that drive freshwater biological invasions. Such efforts are often limited to local scales and/or to single species, due to the challenges of data acquisition at larger scales. Here we map the distribution of exotic freshwater species richness across the continental United States and investigate the role of human activity in driving macroscale patterns of aquatic invasion.Location. The continental United States.Methods. We assembled maps of non-native aquatic species richness by compiling occurrence data on exotic animal and plant species from publicly accessible databases. Using a dasymetric model of human population density and a spatially explicit model of recreational freshwater fishing demand we analyzed the effect of these metrics of human influence on the degree of invasion at the watershed scale, while controlling for spatial and sampling bias. We also assessed the effects that a temporal mismatch between occurrence data (collected since 1815) and cross-sectional predictors (developed using 2010 data) may have on model fit.Results. Non-native aquatic species richness exhibits a highly patchy distribution, with hotspots in the Northeast, Great Lakes, Florida, and human population centers on the Pacific coast. These richness patterns are correlated with population density, but are much more strongly predicted by patterns of recreational fishing demand. These relationships are strengthened by temporal matching of datasets and are robust to corrections for sampling effort.Main Conclusions. Distributions of aquatic invasive species across the continental US are better predicted by freshwater recreational fishing than by human population density. This suggests that observed patterns are driven by a mechanistic link between recreational activity and aquatic invasive species richness, and are not merely the outcome of sampling bias associated with human population density.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Davis, A., and J. Darling. Recreational freshwater fishing drives non-native aquatic species richness patterns at a continental scale (journal). Diversity and Distributions.

",Rapid Effects of the Aromatase Inhibitor Fadrozole on Steroid Production and Gene Expression in the Ovary of Female Fathead Minnows (Pimephales promelas),U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Aromatase inhibition is one of the chemical modes of action of concern to EPA's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). In vitro bioassays that can detect aromatase inhibition are part of both the EDSP tier 1 screening program and are included subset of ToxCast assays employed for EDSP21 screening. An adverse outcome pathway (AOP) linking aromatase inhibition to reproductive dysfunction in fish has been described and endorsed by the OECD, establishing a scientifically sound connection between aromatase inhibition and adverse apical outcomes relevant to risk assessment and regulatory decision-making. Further, computational models that allow for quantitative prediction of dose-response time-course behaviors and the potential severity of the adverse outcome based on in vitro screening data have been developed. The present study provides further weight of evidence to support this AOP and its use in regulatory decision-making. In particular, it identifies rapid responses to aromatase inhibition that can be expected to occur within the first 24 h of exposure, examines the dynamic stability of gene expression responses over that period to help identify appropriate time periods in which characteristic gene expression responses may serve as effective biomarkers of exposure to aromatase inhibitors, and provides insights into different gene regulatory mechanisms that may be operating over the first few hours of exposure versus more systemic endocrine-related regulation that appear to take over after 6-12 h of exposure. These data continue to refine our understanding of this important mode of endocrine disruption and how to more efficiently and effectively both model and test for it to support regulatory decision-making.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Schroeder, A., G.

",Coupling of organic and inorganic systems and the effect on gas-particle partitioning in the southeastern United States,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Several models were used to describe the partitioning of ammonia, water, and organic compounds between the gas and particle phases for conditions in the southeastern US during summer 2013. Existing equilibrium models and frameworks were found to be sufficient, although additional improvements in terms of estimating pure-species vapor pressures are needed. Thermodynamic model predictions were consistent, to first order, with a molar ratio of ammonium to sulfate of approximately 1.6 to 1.8 (ratio of ammonium to 2  x  sulfate, RN/2S    0.8 to 0.9) with approximately 70 % of total ammonia and ammonium (NHx) in the particle. Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Network (SEARCH) gas and aerosol and Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) Monitor for AeRosols and Gases in Ambient air (MARGA) aerosol measurements were consistent with these conditions. CMAQv5.2 regional chemical transport model predictions did not reflect these conditions due to a factor of 3 overestimate of the nonvolatile cations. In addition, gas-phase ammonia was overestimated in the CMAQ model leading to an even lower fraction of total ammonia in the particle. Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) and aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements indicated less ammonium per sulfate than SEARCH and MARGA measurements and were inconsistent with thermodynamic model predictions. Organic compounds were predicted to be present to some extent in the same phase as inorganic constituents, modifying their activity and resulting in a decrease in [H+]air (H+ in ug m-3 air), increase in ammonia partitioning to the gas phase, and increase in pH compared to complete organic vs. inorganic liquid-liquid phase separation. In addition, accounting for nonideal mixing modified the pH such that a fully interactive inorganic-organic system had a pH roughly 0.7 units higher than predicted using traditional methods (pH  =  1.5 vs. 0.7). Particle-phase interactions of organic and inorganic compounds were found to increase partitioning towards the particle phase (vs. gas phase) for highly oxygenated (O : C  >=  0.6) compounds including several isoprene-derived tracers as well as levoglucosan but decrease particle-phase partitioning for low O : C, monoterpene-derived species.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Pye, H., W.

The grab sample, 1L, was collected just below the water surface, directly into a pre-cleaned, organic-free, amber glass bottle. The water sample was extracted by solid phase extraction using an Oasis-HLB glass catridge. Cartidges were conditioned sequentially using 5mL each of ethyl acetate, 50:50 methanol (MeOH):dichloromethane (DCM), MeOH, and water. The extract in DMSO was tested in the Attagene cis- and trans-FactorialTM assays (http://www.attagene.com/technology.php, Martin and others 2010, Romanov and others 2008).

",Taxonomic summary tables for illumina sequences from MEC study on influence of electrical conductivity by microbial activity in biofilm anode,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This study assessed the conductivity of a Geobacter-enriched biofilm anode along with biofilm activity in a microbial electrochemical cell (MxC) equipped with two gold anodes (25 mM acetate medium), as different proton gradients were built throughout the biofilm. There was no pH gradient across the biofilm anode at 100 mM phosphate buffer (current density 2.38 A/m2) and biofilm conductivity (Kbio) was as high as 0.87 mS/cm. In comparison, an inner biofilm became acidic at 2.5 mM phosphate buffer in which approximately 80 mm of the inner biofilm anode was metabolically inactive. At this low phosphate buffer, Kbio significantly decreased by 0.27 mS/cm, together with declined current density of 0.64 A/m2. This work demonstrates that biofilm conductivity depends on metabolic activity of Geobacter in the conductive biofilm anode. The decreased Kbio at acidic environment implies the presence of multiple conduction-EET pathways in the biofilm anode.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Dhar, B., J. Sim, H.

",Estimation of Radiative Efficiency of Chemicals with Potentially Significant Global Warming Potential,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The set of commercially available chemical substances in commerce that may have significant global warming potential (GWP) is not well defined. Although there are currently over 200 chemicals with high GWP reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, World Meteorological Organization, or Environmental Protection Agency, there may be hundreds of additional chemicals that may also have significant GWP. Evaluation of various approaches to estimate radiative efficiency (RE) and atmospheric lifetime will help to refine GWP estimates for compounds where no measured IR spectrum is available. This study compares values of RE calculated using computational chemistry techniques for 235 chemical compounds against the best available values. It is important to assess the reliability of the underlying computational methods for computing RE to understand the sources of deviations from the best available values. Computed vibrational frequency data is used to estimate RE values using several Pinnock-type models. The values derived using these models are found to be in reasonable agreement with reported RE values (though significant improvement is obtained through scaling). The effect of varying the computational method and basis set used to calculate the frequency data is also discussed. It is found that the vibrational intensities have a strong dependence on basis set and are largely responsible for differences in computed values of RE in this study. Deviations of calculated RE values are also analyzed by chemical classification, and it is found that some classes are computed more accurately than others.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Betowski , D., C.

In return for meeting program requirements, Tree City USA participants expect social, economic, and/or environmental benefits. Understanding the geographic distribution and socioeconomic characteristics of Tree City USA communities at the national scale can offer insights into the motivations or barriers to program participation, and provide context for community forestry research at finer scales. In this study, researchers assessed patterns in Tree City USA participation for all U.S. communities with more than 2,500 people according to geography, community population size, and socioeconomic characteristics, such as income, education, and race. Nationally, 23.5% of communities studied were Tree City USA participants, and this accounted for 53.9% of the total population in these communities. Tree City USA participation rates varied substantially by U.S. region, but in each region participation rates were higher in larger communities, and long-term participants tended to be larger communities than more recent enrollees. In logistic regression models, owner occupancy rates were significant negative predictors of Tree City USA participation, education and percent white population were positive predictors in many U.S. regions, and inconsistent patterns were observed for income and population age. The findings indicate that communities with smaller populations, lower education levels, and higher minority populations are underserved regionally by Tree City USA, and future efforts should identify and overcome barriers to participation in these types of communities.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Berland , A., D.

",Permeable pavement study (Edison),U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"While permeable pavement is increasingly being used to control stormwater runoff, field-based, side-by-side investigations on the effects different pavement types have on nutrient concentrations present in stormwater runoff are limited. In 2009, the U.S. EPA constructed a 0.4-ha parking lot in Edison, New Jersey, that incorporated permeable interlocking concrete pavement (PICP), pervious concrete (PC), and porous asphalt (PA). Each permeable pavement type has four, 54.9-m2, lined sections that direct all infiltrate into 5.7-m3 tanks enabling complete volume collection and sampling. This paper highlights the results from a 12-month period when samples were collected from 13 rainfall/runoff events and analyzed for nitrogen species, orthophosphate, and organic carbon. Differences in infiltrate concentrations among the three permeable pavement types were assessed and compared with concentrations in rainwater samples and impervious asphalt runoff samples, which were collected as controls. Contrary to expectations based on the literature, the PA infiltrate had significantly larger total nitrogen (TN) concentrations than runoff and infiltrate from the other two permeable pavement types, indicating that nitrogen leached from materials in the PA strata. There was no significant difference in TN concentration between runoff and infiltrate from either PICP or PC, but TN in runoff was significantly larger than in the rainwater, suggesting meaningful inter-event dry deposition. Similar to other permeable pavement studies, nitrate was the dominant nitrogen species in the infiltrate. The PA infiltrate had significantly larger nitrite and ammonia concentrations than PICP and PC, and this was presumably linked to unexpectedly high pH in the PA infiltrate that greatly exceeded the optimal pH range for nitrifying bacteria. Contrary to the nitrogen results, the PA infiltrate had significantly smaller orthophosphate concentrations than in rainwater, runoff, and infiltrate from PICP and PC, and this was attributed to the high pH in PA infiltrate possibly causing rapid precipitation of orthophosphate with metal cations. Orthophosphate was exported from the PICP and PC, as evidenced by the significantly larger infiltrate concentrations compared with influent sources of rainwater and runoff.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Brown , R., and M.

",Prioritization of Contaminants of Emerging Concern in Wastewater Treatment Plant Discharges using Chemical:Gene Interactions in Caged Fish.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"We examined whether contaminants present in surface waters could be prioritized for further assessment by linking the presence of specific chemicals to gene expression changes in exposed fish. Fathead minnows were deployed in cages for 2, 4, or 8 days at three locations near two different waste water treatment plant discharge sites in the Saint Louis Bay, Duluth, MN and one upstream control site. The biological impact of 51 chemicals detected in the surface water was determined using biochemical endpoints, exposure activity ratios for biological and estrogenic responses, known chemical:gene interactions from biological pathways and knowledge bases, and analysis of the co-variance of ovary gene expression with surface water chemistry. Thirty-two chemicals were significantly linked by co-variance with expressed genes. No estrogenic impact on biochemical endpoints was observed in male or female minnows. However, bisphenol A was identified by chemical:gene co-variation as the most impactful chemical across the exposure sites. This was consistent with identification of estrogenic effects on gene expression, high exposure activity ratios across all test sites, and historical analysis of the area. Overall, this approach appears useful in examining the impacts of complex mixtures on fish and offers a potential route in linking chemical exposure to adverse outcomes that reduce population sustainability.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Perkins, E., T.

Development and evaluation of the R-LINE model algorithms to account for chemical transformation in the near-road environment. Transportation Research Part D, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2018.01.028. To address the need to estimate near-road NO2 concentrations, we implemented three different approaches in order of increasing degrees of complexity and barrier to implementation from simplest to more complex. The first is an empirical approach based upon fitting a 4th order polynomial to existing near-road observations across the continental U.S., the second involves a simplified Two-reaction chemical scheme, and the third involves a more detailed set of chemical reactions based upon the Generic Reaction Set (GRS) mechanism. All models were able to estimate more than 75% of concentrations within a factor of two of the near-road monitoring data and produced comparable performance statistics. These results indicate that the performance of the new R-LINE chemistry algorithms for predicting NO2 is comparable to other models (i.e. ADMS-Roads with GRS), both showing less than+-15% fractional bias and less than 45% normalized mean square error.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Valencia, A., A.

",Climate differentiates forest structure across a residential macrosystem,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The extent of urban ecological homogenization depends on how humans build, inhabit, and manage cities. Morphological and socio-economic facets of neighborhoods can drive the homogenization of forest cover, thus affecting urban ecological and hydrological processes, and ecosystem services. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the same biophysical drivers differentiating composition and structure of natural forests can further counteract the homogenization of urban forests. We hypothesize that climate can differentiate forest structure across residential macrosystems, regional-to-continental discontinuous systems of urban land. To test this hypothesis, forest structure (tree and shrub cover and volume) was measured using LiDAR data and multispectral imagery across a residential macrosystem composed of 9 cities, 1503 neighborhoods, and 1.4 million residential parcels. Cities were selected along a potential evapotranspiration (PET) gradient in the conterminous United States, ranging from the colder continental climate of Fargo, North Dakota (PET = 66.21 mm) to the hotter subtropical climate of Tallahassee, Florida (PET = 160.49 mm). The relative effects of climate, urban morphology, and socio-economic variables on residential forest structure were assessed by using generalized linear models. Climate differentiated forest structure of the residential macrosystem as hypothesized. Average forest cover doubled along the PET gradient (0.39 - 0.78 m2 m-2), whereas average forest volume had a threefold increase (2.50 - 8.12 m3 m-2). Forest volume across neighborhoods increased exponentially with forest cover. Urban morphology had a greater effect in homogenizing forest structure on residential parcels compared to socio-economics. Climate and urban morphology variables best predicted residential forest structure, whereas socio-economic variables had the lowest predictive power. Results indicate that climate can differentiate forest structure across residential macrosystems and may counteract the homogenizing effects of urban morphology and socio-economic drivers at city-wide scales. This resonates with recent empirical work suggesting the existence of complex multi-scalar mechanisms that regulate ecological homogenization and ecosystem convergence among cities. The study initiates high-resolution assessments of forest structure across entire urban macrosystems and breaks new ground for research on the ecological and hydrological significance of urban vegetation at subcontinental scale.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Ossola, A., and M.

The work included controls development, component and vehicle modeling , and model validation for simulations of a vehicle with a 48 V Belt Integrated Starter Generator (BISG) MHEV system. An initial model design was also developed for a 48 V inline on-axis P2-configuration MHEV and will be validated as part of future work. Both MHEV configurations were developed into sub-models using a MATLAB/Simulink/Stateflow tool. The sub-models have subsequently been integrated into EPA's ALPHA vehicle model. Initial sub-model development and validation was conducted using the commercially-available Gamma Technology GT-DRIVE vehicle simulation model. The mild hybrid electric vehicle model was validated using vehicle data obtained from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) chassis dynamometer tests of a 2013 Chevrolet Malibu Eco 115 V 15 kW BISG mild hybrid electric vehicle. The simulated fuel economy, engine torque/speed, motor torque/speed, engine on-off controls, battery voltage, current, and State of Charge (SOC) were all in good agreement with the vehicle test data on a number of drive schedules. The developed 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicle model can be used to estimate the GHG emissions and fuel economy of 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicles over the EPA regulatory drive cycles and to estimate off-cycle GHG emissions, real-world GHG emissions, and vehicle energy flows. The 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicle model will be further validated with additional 48 V mild hybrid electric vehicle test data in the future as more vehicle models become available.

Characterization of pollutant dispersion near elongated buildings based on wind tunnel simulations, Atmospheric Environment, 142, 286-295. The paper presents a wind tunnel study of the effects of elongated rectangular buildings on the dispersion of pollutants from nearby stacks. The study examines the influence of source location, building aspect ratio, and wind direction on pollutant dispersion with the goal of developing improved algorithms within dispersion models. The paper also examines the current AERMOD/PRIME modeling capabilities compared to wind tunnel observations. Differences in the amount of plume material entrained in the wake region downwind of a building for various source locations and source heights are illustrated with vertical and lateral concentration profiles. These profiles were parameterized using the Gaussian equation and show the influence of building/source configurations on those parameters. When the building is oriented at 45deg to the approach flow, for example, the effective plume height descends more rapidly than it does for a perpendicular building, enhancing the resulting surface concentrations in the wake region. Buildings at angles to the wind cause a cross-wind shift in the location of the plume resulting from a lateral mean flow established in the building wake. These and other effects that are not well represented in many dispersion models are important considerations when developing improved algorithms to estimate the location and magnitude of concentrations downwind of elongated buildings.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Perry , S., D.

","Soot, organics, and ultrafine ash from air- and oxy-fired coal combustion",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Pulverized bituminous coal was burned in a 10W externally heated entrained flow furnace under air-combustion and three oxy-combustion inlet oxygen conditions (28, 32, and 36%). Experiments were designed to produce flames with practically relevant stoichiometric ratios (SR=1.2-1.4) and constant residence times (2.3s). Size-classified fly ash samples were collected, and measurements focused on the soot, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC) composition of the total and ultrafine (<0.6um) fly ash. Results indicate that although the total fly ash carbon, as measured by loss on ignition, was always acceptably low (<2%) with all three oxy-combustion conditions lower than air-combustion, the ultrafine fly ash for both air-fired and oxy-fired combustion conditions consists primarily of carbonaceous material (50-95%). Carbonaceous components on particles <0.6um measured by a thermal optical method showed that large fractions (52-93%) consisted of OC rather than EC, as expected. This observation was supported by thermogravimetric analysis indicating that for the air, 28% oxy, and 32% oxy conditions, 14-71% of this material may be OC volatilizing between 100 and 550degC with the remaining 29-86% being EC/soot. However, for the 36% oxy condition, OC may comprise over 90% of the ultrafine carbon with a much smaller EC/soot contribution. These data were interpreted by considering the effects of oxy-combustion on flame attachment, ignition delay, and soot oxidation of a bituminous coal, and the effects of these processes on OC and EC emissions. Flame aerodynamics and inlet oxidant composition may influence emissions of organic hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from a bituminous coal. During oxy-coal combustion, judicious control of inlet oxygen concentration and placement may be used to minimize organic HAP and soot emissions.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Andersen, M., N.

",Weight of evidence evaluation of a network of adverse outcome pathways linking activaiton of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in honey bees to colony death,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Ongoing honey bee colony losses are of significant international concern because of the essential role these insects play in pollinating many high nutrient crops, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to colony failure, however, the potential role(s) of commonly-used neonicotinoid insecticides has emerged as particularly concerning. Neonicotinoids act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous system to eliminate target pest insects. However, mounting evidence indicates that these neonicotinoids also may adversely affect beneficial pollinators, such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera), via impairments on learning and memory, and ultimately foraging success. The specific mechanisms linking activation of the nAChR to adverse effects on learning and memory are uncertain. Additionally, clear connections between observed impacts on individual bees and colony level effects are lacking. The objective of this review was to develop adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) as a means to evaluate the biological plausibility and empirical evidence supporting (or refuting) the linkage between activation of the physiological target site, the nAChR, and colony level consequences. Development of AOPs has led to the identification of research gaps which, for example, may be of high priority in understanding how perturbation of pathways involved in neurotransmission can adversely affect normal colony functions, causing colony instability and subsequent bee population failure. A putative AOP network was developed, laying the foundation for further insights as to the role of combined chemical and non-chemical stressors in impacting bee populations. Insights gained from the putative AOP network assembly, which more realistically represents multi-stressor impacts on honey bee colonies, are promising toward understanding common sensitive nodes in key biological pathways and identifying where mitigation strategies may be focused to reduce colony losses.

",Measuring urban tree loss dynamics across residential landscapes,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The spatial arrangement of urban vegetation depends on urban morphology and socio-economic settings. Urban vegetation changes over time because of human management. Urban trees are removed due to hazard prevention or aesthetic preferences. Previous research attributed tree loss to decreases in canopy cover. However, this provides little information about location and structural characteristics of trees lost, as well as environmental and social factors affecting tree loss dynamics. This is particularly relevant in residential landscapes where access to residential parcels for field surveys is limited. We tested whether multi-temporal airborne LiDAR and multi-spectral imagery collected at a 5-year interval can be used to investigate urban tree loss dynamics across residential landscapes in Denver, CO and Milwaukee, WI, covering 400,705 residential parcels in 444 census tracts. Position and stem height of trees lost were extracted from canopy height models calculated as the difference between final (year 5) and initial (year 0) vegetation height derived from LiDAR. Multivariate regression models were used to predict number and height of tree stems lost in residential parcels in each census tract based on urban morphological and socio-economic variables. A total of 28,427 stems were lost from residential parcels in Denver and Milwaukee over 5 years. Overall, 7% of residential parcels lost one stem, averaging 90.87 stems per km2. Average stem height was 10.16 m, though trees lost in Denver were taller compared to Milwaukee. The number of stems lost was higher in neighborhoods with higher canopy cover and developed before the 1970s. However, socio-economic characteristics had little effect on tree loss dynamics. The study provides a robust method for measuring urban tree loss dynamics within and across entire cities, and represents a first step towards high resolution assessments of the three-dimensional change of urban vegetation at large spatial scales.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Ossola, A., and M.

","Triclosan Concentration Data for Lydon et al., 2017",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products, including antimicrobials, can be found at trace levels in treated wastewater effluent. Impacts of chemical contaminants on coastal aquatic microbial community structure and pathogen abundance are unknown despite the potential for selection through antimicrobial resistance. In particular, Vibrio, a marine bacterial genus that includes several human pathogens, displays resistance to the ubiquitous antimicrobial compound triclosan. Here we demonstrated through use of natural seawater microcosms that triclosan (at a concentration of ~5 ppm) can induce a significant Vibrio growth response (68-1,700 fold increases) in comparison with no treatment controls for three distinct coastal ecosystems: Looe Key Reef (Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary), Doctors Arm Canal (Big Pine Key, FL), and Clam Bank Landing (North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown, SC). Additionally, microbial community analysis by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing for Looe Key Reef showed distinct changes in microbial community structure with exposure to 5 ppm triclosan, with increases observed in the relative abundance of Vibrionaceae (17-fold), Pseudoalteromonadaceae (65-fold), Alteromonadaceae (108-fold), Colwelliaceae (430-fold), and Oceanospirillaceae (1,494-fold). While the triclosan doses tested were above concentrations typically observed in coastal surface waters, results identify bacterial families that are potentially resistant to triclosan and/or adapted to use triclosan as a carbon source. The results further suggest the potential for selection of Vibrio in coastal environments, especially sediments, where triclosan may accumulate at high levels.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Lydon, K.A., D.

Dark-control exposures produced non-mutagenic atmospheres, illustrating that the gas-phase precursor VOCs were not mutagenic at the concentrations tested. Under irradiation, all but m-cresol and naphthalene produced mutagenic atmospheres, with potencies ranging from 2.0 (p-xylene) to 10.4 (ethylbenzene) revertants m3 mgC-1 h-1. The mutagenicity was due exclusively to direct-acting late-generation products of the photooxidation reactions. Gas-phase chemical analysis showed that a number of oxidized organic chemical species enhanced during the irradiated exposure experiments correlated (r >= 0.81) with the mutagenic potencies of the atmospheres. Molecular formulas assigned to these species indicated that they likely contained peroxy acid, aldehyde, alcohol, and other functionalities.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Riedel, T., D.

","Genetic Targets of Acute Toluene Inhalation in Drosophila melanogaster: DGRP activity, overlapping human orthologs, pathway analyses, GWAS results",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"We used the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP), a collection of ~200 homozygous lines of fruit flies whose genomes have been sequenced. We quantified toluene-induced suppression of motor activity in 123 lines of these flies during exposure to toluene, a volatile organic compound known to induce narcosis in mammals via its effects on neuronal ion channels. We then applied genome-wide association analyses on this effect of toluene using the DGRP web portal (http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu), which identified polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with the variation in response to toluene exposure. We tested ~2 million variants and found 82 polymorphisms located in or near 66 candidate genes that were associated with phenotypic variation for sensitivity to toluene at P < 5 x 10-5, and human orthologs for 52 of these candidate Drosophila genes. None of these orthologs are known to be involved in canonical pathways for mammalian neuronal ion channels, including GABA, glutamate, dopamine, glycine, serotonin, and voltage sensitive calcium channels.This dataset is associated with the following publications: Bushnell, P., W.

",Use of Bayesian Modeling to Assess Occurrence of Viral Pathogens in Multiple US Drinking Water Systems,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Drinking water treatment plants rely on purification of contaminated source waters to provide communities with potable water. One group of possible contaminants are enteric viruses. Measurement of viral quantities in environmental water systems are often performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or quantitative PCR (qPCR). However, true values may be underestimated due to challenges involved in a multi-step viral concentration process and due to PCR inhibition. In this study, water samples were concentrated from 25 drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) across the US to study the occurrence of enteric viruses in source water and removal after treatment. The five different types of viruses studied were adenovirus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, enterovirus, and polyomavirus. Quantitative PCR was performed on all samples to determine presence or absence of these viruses in each sample. Ten DWTPs showed presence of one or more viruses in source water, with four DWTPs having treated drinking water testing positive. Furthermore, PCR inhibition was assessed for each sample using an exogenous amplification control, which indicated that all of the DWTP samples, including source and treated water samples, had some level of inhibition, confirming that inhibition plays an important role in PCR-based assessments of environmental samples. PCR inhibition measurements, viral recovery, and other assessments were incorporated into a Bayesian model to more accurately determine viral load in both source and treated water. Results of the Bayesian model indicated that viruses are present in source water and treated water. By using a Bayesian framework that incorporates inhibition, as well as many other parameters that affect viral detection, this study offers an approach for more accurately estimating the occurrence of viral pathogens in environmental waters.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Varughese, E., N.

",High-resolution Mass Spectrometry of Skin Mucus for Monitoring Physiological Impacts and Contaminant Biotransformation Products in Fathead Minnows Exposed to Wastewater Effluent,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"High-resolution mass spectrometry is advantageous for monitoring physiological impacts and contaminant biotransformation products in fish exposed to complex wastewater effluent. We evaluated this technique using skin mucus from male and female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to control water or treated wastewater effluent at 5%, 20%, and 100% levels for 21 d, using an onsite, flow-through system providing real-time exposure. Both sex-specific and non-sex-specific responses were observed in the mucus metabolome, the latter suggesting the induction of general compensatory pathways for xenobiotic exposures. Altogether, 85 statistically significant treatment-dependent metabolite changes were observed and 30 of those annotated with probable structures. The mummichog software package was used to elucidate impacted biochemical pathways and enhance metabolite annotation. Partial least squares regression models revealed relationships between the mucus metabolomes and upregulated hepatic mRNA transcripts reported previously for these same fish. These regression models suggest that mucus metabolomic changes reflected, in part, processes by which the fish biotransformed xenobiotics in the effluent. Further, we detected a phase II transformation product of bisphenol A in the skin mucus of male fish. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of mucus as a minimally invasive matrix for simultaneously assessing exposures and effects of real-world mixtures of contaminants.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Mosley, J., D.

",Simulating the hydrologic impacts of land cover and climate changes in a semi-arid watershed,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Changes in climate and land cover are among the principal variables affecting watershed hydrology. This paper uses a cell-based model to examine the hydrologic impacts of climate and land-cover changes in the semi-arid Lower Virgin River (LVR) watershed located upstream of Lake Mead, Nevada, USA. The cell-based model is developed by considering direct runoff based on the Soil Conservation Service - Curve Number (SCSCN) method and surplus runoff based on the Thornthwaite water balance theory. After calibration and validation, the model is used to predict LVR discharge under future climate and land-cover changes. The hydrologic simulation results reveal climate change as the dominant factor and land-cover change as a secondary factor in regulating future river discharge. The combined effects of climate and land-cover changes will slightly increase river discharge in summer but substantially decrease discharge in winter. This impact on water resources deserves attention in climate change adaptation planning.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Chen, H., S. Tong, H. Yang, and J. Yang.

",High-Throughput Dietary Exposure Predictions for Chemical Migrants from Food Contact Substances for Use in Chemical Prioritization,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Under the ExpoCast program, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) researchers have developed a high-throughput (HT) framework for estimating aggregate exposures to chemicals from multiple pathways to support rapid prioritization of chemicals. Here, we present methods to estimate HT exposures to chemicals migrating into food from food contact substances (FCS). These methods consisted of combining an empirical model of chemical migration with estimates of daily population food intakes derived from food diaries from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). A linear regression model for migration at equilibrium was developed by fitting available migration measurements as a function of temperature, food type (i.e., fatty, aqueous, acidic, alcoholic), initial chemical concentration in the FCS (C0) and chemical properties. The most predictive variables in the resulting model were C0, molecular weight, log Kow, and food type (R2=0.71, p<0.0001). Migration-based concentrations for 1009 chemicals identified via publicly-available data sources as being present in polymer FCSs were predicted for 12 food groups (combinations of 3 storage temperatures and food type). The model was parameterized with screening-level estimates of C0 based on the functional role of chemical in FCS. By combining these concentrations with daily intakes for food groups derived from NHANES, population ingestion exposures of chemical in mg/kg-bodyweight/day (mg/kg-BW/day) were estimated. Calibrated aggregate exposures were estimated for 1931 chemicals by fitting HT FCS and consumer product exposures to exposures inferred from NHANES biomonitoring (R2=0.61, p<0.001), both FCS and consumer product pathway exposures were significantly predictive of inferred exposures. Including the FCS pathway significantly impacted the ratio of predicted exposures to those estimated to produce steady-state blood concentrations equal to in-vitro bioactive concentrations. While these HT methods have large uncertainties (and thus may not be appropriate for assessments of single chemicals), they can provide critical refinement to aggregate exposure predictions used in risk-based chemical priority-setting.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Biryol, D., C.

Substantial increase of the Treponema population was observed in the biofilm anode at Eanode=+0.2 V, which reduced intracellular electron-transfer kinetics associated with the maximum specific substrate-utilization rate by a factor of ten. This result suggests that fast EET kinetics can be maintained under dynamic Eanode conditions in a highly conductive biofilm anode as a result of shift of main EET players in the biofilm anode, although Eanode changes can influence IET kinetics.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Dhar, B., H.

Toxicol. Chem. 35:717-727. Individual rainbow trout were exposed to PFOS by bolus injection (elimination studies) or by adding PFOS to incoming water (branchial uptake studies). The trout were fitted with indwelling catheters and urinary cannulae to permit periodic collection of blood and urine. Additional sampling was conducted to evaluate PFOS uptake from and elimination to respired water. Data obtained from each fish was evaluated using a clearance-volume pharmacokinetic model. Modeled kinetic parameters were then averaged to develop summary statistics which were used as a basis for interpreting modeled results and making comparisons to a previous study of rainbow trout exposed to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA, Consoer et al., 2014, Aquat. Toxicol. 156:65-73). The results of this study, combined with that of the previous PFOA study, suggest that PFOA is a substrate for renal transporters in fish while glomerular filtration alone may be sufficient to explain the observed renal elimination of PFOS. These findings demonstrate that models developed to predict the bioaccumulation of perfluoroalkyl acids by fish must account for differences in renal clearance of individual compounds.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Consoer, D., A.

",Assessment of the Bioaccessibility of Micronized Copper Wood on Simulated Stomach Fluid,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The widespread use of copper-treated lumber has increased the potential for human exposure. Moreover, there is a lack of information on the fate and behavior of copper-treated wood particles following oral ingestion. In this study, the in vitro bioaccessibility of copper from copper-treated wood dust in simulated stomach fluid and DI water was determined. Three copper-treated wood products, liquid alkali copper quaternary and two micronized copper quarternary from different manufacturers, were incubated in the extraction media then fractionated by centrifugation and filtration through 0.45 m and 10 kDa filters. The copper concentrations from isolated fractions were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Total amounts of copper from each wood product were also determined using microwave-assisted acid digestion of dried wood samples and quantification using ICP-OES. The percent in vitro bioaccessible copper was between 83 and 90 % for all treated wood types. However, the percent of copper released in DI water was between 14 and 25 % for all wood products. This data suggests that copper is highly bioaccessible at low pH and may pose a potential human exposure risk upon ingestion.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Santiago-Rodrigues, L., J.L.

The USEPA AGB product (15 m) was created to support the development of landscape watershed predictor metrics for sediment and nutrient loadings associated with stream reaches. Above-ground forest biomass was estimated at a 15 m spatial resolution implementing methodology first posited by the Woods Hole Research Center where they developed the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset (NBCD2000) - an above-ground forest biomass map (30 m) for the conterminous United States. For EPA's effort, spatial predictor layers for AGB estimation included derived products from the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD) cover type and tree canopy density data, the USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP) forest type classification data, USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) topographic data, and the National Aeronautical and Space Administration's (NASA's) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) tree height data. These predictor variables and Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) response variables (observed canopy height and AGB) were related through multivariate tree-based regression models. Units for this AGB map are in Mg/ha for each 15m pixel. Mean biomass (forest only) for the 15 m pixels was 72.59 Mg/ha (s = 26.83). This estimate is close in agreement to an assessment of structure and condition of PR forests (2003) (Brandeis, 2006) where mean AGB was estimated at 80 Mg/ha.Brandeis, T.J., M.B. Delaney, R.

",Estimating environmental co-benefits of U.S. low-carbon pathways using the GCAM-USA integrated assessment model,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"There are many technological pathways that can lead to reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, these pathways can have substantially different impacts on other environmental endpoints, such as air quality and energy-related water demand. This study uses an integrated assessment model with state-level resolution of the U.S. energy system to compare environmental impacts of alternative low-carbon pathways. One set of pathways emphasizes nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage (NUC/CCS), while another set emphasizes renewable energy (RE). These are compared with pathways in which all technologies are available. Air pollutant emissions, mortality costs attributable to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and energy-related water demands are evaluated for 50% and 80% CO2 reduction targets in the U.S. in 2050. The RE low-carbon pathways require less water withdrawal and consumption than the NUC/CCS pathways because of the large cooling demands of nuclear power and CCS. However, the NUC/CCS low-carbon pathways produce greater health benefits, mainly because the NUC/CCS assumptions result in less primary PM2.5 emissions from residential wood combustion. Environmental co-benefits differ among states because of factors such as existing technology stock, resource availability, and environmental and energy policies. An important finding is that biomass in the building sector can offset some of the health co-benefits of the low-carbon pathways even though it plays only a minor role in reducing CO2 emissions.

However, for understanding individual reproductive health and modeling purposes it is important to estimate individual fecundity from group fecundity. A multi-stage method was developed that disaggregates group level data into estimates for individual-level clutch size and spawning interval distributions. The disaggregation technique was verified by combining data from fathead minnow pairs, and checking that the disaggregation method reproduced the original clutch sizes and spawning intervals.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Nishimura, J., R.

",Metabolite profiles of repeatedly sampled urine from male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) contain unique lipid signatures following exposure to anti-androgens,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we sought to identify candidate markers of exposure to antiandrogens by analyzing endogenous metabolite profiles in the urine of male fathead minnows (mFHM, Pimephales promelas). Based on earlier work, we hypothesized that unidentified lipids in the urine of mFHM were selectively responsive to exposure to androgen receptor antagonists,which is otherwise difficult to confirm using established fish toxicity assays. A second goal was to evaluate the feasibility of non-lethally and repeatedly sampling urine from individual mFHMs over the time course of response to a chemical exposure. Accordingly, we exposed mFHM to the model anti-androgens vinclozolin or flutamide. Urine was collected from each fish at 48 hour intervals over the course of a 14 day exposure. Parallel experiments were conducted with mFHM exposed to bisphenol A or control water. The frequent handling/sampling regime did not cause apparent adverse effects on the fish. Endogenous metabolite profiling was conducted with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which exhibited lower variation for the urinary metabolome than was found in earlier work with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Specifically, for inter- and intra-individual variations, the median spectrum-wide relative standard deviation (RSD) was 32.6% and 33.3%, respectively, for GC-MS analysis of urine from unexposed mFHM. These results compared favorably with similar measurements of urine from other model species, including the Sprague Dawley rat. In addition, GC-MS allowed us to identify several lipids (e.g., certain saturated fatty acids) in mFHM urine as candidate markers of exposure to androgen receptor antagonists. The dataset that is uploaded here is the complete processed data from GC-MS instrument.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Collette , T., D. Skelton, J. Davis , J.

",Determining Pathogen and Indicator Levels in Class B Municipal Organic Residuals Used for Land Application,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Biosolids are nutrient rich organic residuals that are currently used to amend soils for food production. Treatment requirements to inactivate pathogens for production of Class A biosolids are energy intensive. One less energy intensive alternative is to treat biosolids to Class B standards, but it could result in higher pathogen loads. Quantitative microbial risk assessments models have been developed on land application of Class B biosolids, but contain many uncertainties because of limited data on specific pathogen densities and the use of fecal indicator organisms as accurate surrogates of pathogen loads. To address this gap, a 12-month study of the levels and relationships between Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and human adenovirus (HAdV) with fecal coliform, somatic and F-RNA coliphage levels in Class B biosolids from nine wastewater treatment plants throughout the United States was conducted. Results revealed that fecal coliform, somatic, and F-RNA coliphage densities were consistent throughout the year. More importantly, results revealed that HAdV (=2.5x103 genome copies/dry g) and Giardia (=4.14 x103 cysts/dry g) were in all biosolids samples regardless of treatment processes, location, or season. Cryptosporidium oocysts were also detected (38 % positive, range: 0 -1.9 x 103 oocysts/dry g), albeit sporadically. Positive correlations among three fecal indicator organisms and HAdV, but not protozoa, were also observed. Overall, study reveals the high concentrations of enteric pathogens (e.g., Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and HAdV) are present in biosolids throughout the US. Microbial densities found can further assist management and policy makers establish more accurate risk assessment models associated with land application of Class B biosolids.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Rhodes , E., L.

",Water quality modeling in the dead end sections of drinking water (Supplement),U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Dead-end sections of drinking water distribution networks are known to be problematic zones in terms of water quality degradation. Extended residence time due to water stagnation leads to rapid reduction of disinfectant residuals allowing the regrowth of microbial pathogens. Water quality models developed so far apply spatial aggregation and temporal averaging techniques for hydraulic parameters by assigning hourly averaged water demands to the main nodes of the network. Although this practice has generally resulted in minimal loss of accuracy for the predicted disinfectant concentrations in main water transmission lines, this is not the case for the peripheries of the distribution network. This study proposes a new approach for simulating disinfectant residuals in dead end pipes while accounting for both spatial and temporal variability in hydraulic and transport parameters. A stochastic demand generator was developed to represent residential water pulses based on a non-homogenous Poisson process. Dispersive solute transport was considered using highly dynamic dispersion rates. A genetic algorithm was used to calibrate the axial hydraulic profile of the dead-end pipe based on the different demand shares of the withdrawal nodes. A parametric sensitivity analysis was done to assess the model performance under variation of different simulation parameters. A group of Monte-Carlo ensembles was carried out to investigate the influence of spatial and temporal variations in flow demands on the simulation accuracy. A set of three correction factors were analytically derived to adjust residence time, dispersion rate and wall demand to overcome simulation error caused by spatial aggregation approximation. The current model results show better agreement with field-measured concentrations of conservative fluoride tracer and free chlorine disinfectant than the simulations of recent advection dispersion reaction models published in the literature. Accuracy of the simulated concentration profiles showed significant dependence on the spatial distribution of the flow demands compared to temporal variation.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Abokifa, A., J.

The method employs on-line solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC/MS/MS). On-line SPE-LC/MS/MS has the potential to offer cost-effective, faster, more sensitive, and more rugged methods than the traditional off-line SPE approach due to complete automation of the SPE process, as well as seamless integration with the LC/MS/MS system.

The method used here involves integrated sampling that is designed to allow for detailed and specific chemical analysis of particulate matter (PM) in the Bakersfield airshed. To achieve this objective, filter samples were taken during thirty-four 23-hr periods between 19 May and 26 June 2010 and analyzed for organic tracers by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Contributions to organic carbon (OC) were determined by two organic tracer-based techniques: primary OC by chemical mass balance and secondary OC by a mass fraction method. Radiocarbon (14C) measurements of the total organic carbon were also made to determine the split between the modern and fossil carbon and thereby constrain unknown sources of OC not accounted for by either tracer-based attribution technique. From the analysis, OC contributions from four primary sources and four secondary sources were determined, which comprised three sources of modern carbon and five sources of fossil carbon. The major primary sources of OC were from vegetative detritus (9.8%), diesel (2.3%), gasoline (<1.0%), and lubricating oil impacted motor vehicle exhaust (30%), measured secondary sources resulted from isoprene (1.5%), a-pinene (<1.0%), toluene (<1.0%), and naphthalene (<1.0%, as an upper limit) contributions. The average observed organic carbon (OC) was 6.42 +- 2.33 mgC m-3. The 14C derived apportionment indicated that modern and fossil components were nearly equivalent on average, however, the fossil contribution ranged from 32-66% over the five week campaign. With the fossil primary and secondary sources aggregated, only 25% of the fossil organic carbon could not be attributed. Whereas, nearly 80% of the modern carbon could not be attributed to primary and secondary sources accessible to this analysis, which included tracers of biomass burning, vegetative detritus and secondary biogenic carbon.

",Predicting Thermal Behavior of Secondary Organic Aerosols,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Volume concentrations of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) are measured in 139 steady-state, single precursor hydrocarbon oxidation experiments after passing through a temperature controlled inlet. The response to change in temperature is well predicted through a feedforward Artificial Neural Network. The most parsimonious model, as indicated by Akaike's Information Criterion, Corrected (AIC,C), utilizes 11 input variables, a single hidden layer of 4 tanh activation function nodes, and a single linear output function. This model predicts thermal behavior of single precursor aerosols to less than +- 5%, which is within the measurement uncertainty, while limiting the problem of overfitting. Prediction of thermal behavior of SOA can be achieved by a concise number of descriptors of the precursor hydrocarbon including the number of internal and external double bonds, number of methyl- and ethyl- functional groups, molecular weight, number of ring structures, in addition to the volume of SOA formed, and an indicator of which of four oxidant precursors was used to initiate reactions (NOx photo-oxidation, photolysis of H2O2, ozonolysis, or thermal decomposition of N2O5). Additional input variables, such as, chamber volumetric residence time, relative humidity, initial concentration of oxides of nitrogen, reacted hydrocarbon concentration, and further descriptors of the precursor hydrocarbon, including carbon number, number of oxygen atoms, and number of aromatic ring structures, lead to over fit models, and are unnecessary for an efficient, accurate predictive model of thermal behavior of SOA.

In collaboration with the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), EPA designed the WSTB facility to support full-scale evaluations of water infrastructure decontamination, real-time sensors, mobile water treatment systems, and decontamination of premise plumbing and appliances. The EPA research focused on decontamination of 1) Bacillus globigii (BG) spores, a non-pathogenic surrogate for Bacillus anthracis and 2) Bakken crude oil. Flushing and chlorination effectively removed most BG spores from the bulk water but BG spores still remained on the pipe wall coupons. Soluble oil components of Bakken crude oil were removed by flushing although oil components persisted in the dishwasher and refrigerator water dispenser. Using this full-scale distribution system allows EPA to 1) test contaminants without any human health or ecological risk and 2) inform water systems on effective methodologies responding to possible contamination incidents.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Szabo, J., J.

In a previous study, we adapted AMBI for use in US coastal waters (US AMBI), but saw biases in salinity and score distribution when compared to locally calibrated indices. In this study we modified M-AMBI for US waters and compared its performance to that of US AMBI. Index performance was evaluated in three ways: 1) concordance with local indices presently being used as management tools in three geographic regions of US coastal waters, 2) classification accuracy for sites defined a priori as good or bad and 3) insensitivity to natural environmental gradients. US M-AMBI was highly correlated with all three local indices and removed the compression in response seen in moderately disturbed sites with US AMBI.

",Assessing threats of non-native species to native freshwater biodiversity: Conservation priorities for the United States,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Non-native species pose one of the greatest threats to native biodiversity, and may have particularly severe negative impacts in freshwater ecosystems. Identifying regions of spatial overlap between high freshwater biodiversity value and elevated stress associated with non-native species can thus inform the determination of conservation priorities. Here we employ geospatial analysis of species distribution data at the watershed scale, extracted from publicly available databases, to investigate the potential threat of non-native species to vulnerable aquatic animal taxa across the continental United States. We mapped non-native aquatic plant and animal species richness and an index of cumulative invasion pressure, which weights non-native richness by time since introduction in order to estimate overall negative impact associated with species introductions. These distributions were compared to distributions of native aquatic animal taxa (fish, amphibians, mollusks, and decapods) derived from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) database. To identify hotspots of native biodiversity value we mapped overall species richness, proportion of species listed by IUCN as threatened and endangered, and a community index of species rarity calculated at the watershed scale. An overall priority index allowed identification of watersheds experiencing high pressure from non-native species and also exhibiting high native biodiversity conservation value. While these priority regions are roughly consistent with previously reported attempts to map biodiversity conservation needs across the US, we also recognize novel priority areas characterized by moderate-to-high native diversity but extremely high invasion pressure. We further explore the utility of this approach by comparing priority areas with existing conservation protections as well as projected future threats associated with land use change. Our findings suggest that many regions of elevated freshwater biodiversity value are compromised by high invasion pressure, and also may be poorly safeguarded by existing conservation mechanisms and likely to experience significant additional stresses in the future.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Panlasigui, S., A.

",Raw data for seed germination study with biochar and 8 plant species.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Biochar is being evaluated as an amendment to improve soil characteristics to increase crop yields, revitalize degraded soils and facilitate the establishment of plant cover. Unfortunately, there are few rapid tests to determine potential effects of biochar on soil and associated plant responses. Seed germination (emergence of hypocotyl) is a critical parameter for plant establishment and may be a rapid indicator of biochar effects. We adapted Oregon State University Seed Laboratory procedures to develop a ""rapid-test"" to screen for effects of biochar on seed germination and soil characteristics. Soils were amended with 1% biochar by weight and placed in 11.0 cm square x 3.5 cm deep containers fitted with premoistened blotter paper. Seeds were placed in a uniform 5 x 5 pattern and covered with 15 g of the soil-biochar mixtures. Two South Carolina Coastal Plain soils, the Norfolk (Fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kandiudults) and Coxville (Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Paleaquults), were used. Eighteen biochars were evaluated produced from 6 feedstocks [pine chips (PC), poultry litter (PL), swine solids (SS), switchgrass (SG), and two blends of PC and PL, 50% PC/50% PL (55), and 80% PC/20% PL (82). For each feedstock biochars were made by pyrolysis at 350, 500 and 700degC for 1-2 hours. Percent germination and shoot dry weight were evaluated for cabbage, carrot, cucumber, lettuce, oat, onion, perennial ryegrass and tomato. Soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and extractable phosphorus (EP), factors which can affect seed germination and early seedling growth, were determined after plant harvests. Germination primarily was affected by soil type with few biochar effects. Shoot dry weight was increased for carrot, lettuce, oat and tomato, primarily with biochars containing PL. Soil pH and EC increased with PL, SS, 55 and most 82 treatments across soil types and plant species. Soil EP increased substantially with SS and PL and to a lesser extent with 55 and 82 for both soils across species, and with SG pyrolyzed at 550 and 750degC soil for the Norfolk soil across species. Thus, this rapid-test method can be an early indicator of the effects of biochar on seed germination and important soil health characteristics which can be affected by biochar and effect seed germination.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Olszyk, D.M., T.

",Chemical composition of isoprene SOA under acidic and non-acidic conditions: Effect of relative humidity,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The effect of acidity and relative humidity on bulk isoprene aerosol parameters has been investigated in several studies, however few measurements have been conducted on individual aerosol compounds. The focus of this study has been the examination of the effect of acidity and relative humidity on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) chemical composition from isoprene photooxidation in the presence of nitrogen oxide (NOx). A detailed characterization of SOA at the molecular level was also investigated. Experiments were conducted in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber operated in flow mode. Based on a detailed analysis of mass spectra obtained from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of silylated derivatives in electron impact and chemical ionization modes, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/time-of-flight high resolution mass spectrometry, and collision-induced dissociation in the negative ionization modes, we characterized not only typical isoprene products, but also new oxygenated compounds. A series of nitroxy-organosulfates (OS) were tentatively identified on the basis of high resolution mass spectra. Under acidic conditions, the major identified compounds include 2-methyltetrols (2MT), 2-methylglyceric acid (2MGA) and 2MT-OS. Other products identified include epoxydiols, mono- and dicarboxylic acids, other organic sulfates, and nitroxy- and nitrosoxy-OS. The contribution of SOA products from isoprene oxidation to PM2.5 was investigated by analysing ambient aerosol collected at rural sites in Poland. Methyltetrols, 2MGA and several organosulfates and nitroxy-OS were detected in both the field and laboratory samples. The influence of relative humidity on SOA formation was modest in non-acidic seed experiments, and stronger under acidic seed aerosol. Total secondary organic carbon decreased with increasing relative humidity under both acidic and non-acidic conditions. While the yields of some of the specific organic compounds decreased with increasing relative humidity others varied in an indeterminate manner from changes in the relative humidity.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Nestorowicz, K., M.

Specifically, Part III evaluated viscosity and metal corrosion as practical issues in the transition from limestone to lime sludge at power plants. Results of Marsh funnel viscosity experiments conducted at different solids contents and temperatures indicated the limestone and lime sludge slurries and their gypsum counterparts had similar flow characteristics. Carbon-steel, stainless-steel, and Hastelloy coupons were tested for corrosion by lime sludge and limestone slurries. Both stainless steel and Hastelloy were resistive to corrosion in slurries made from lime sludge or limestone samples or their gypsum counterparts. A considerable but similar amount of corrosion was observed for carbon-steel coupons exposed to lime sludge and limestone slurries. Adding 5000 ppm of Cl to slurries considerably increased the corrosion rate of carbon steel.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Dastgheib, S., J. Mock, H. Salih, and C.

MULC data categorize the landscape into these land cover classes: impervious surface, tree, grass-herbaceous, shrub, soil-barren, water, wetland and agriculture. MULC data are used to calculate approximately 100 EnviroAtlas metrics that serve as indicators of nature's benefits (ecosystem goods and services). MULC, a dataset for which development is ongoing, is produced by multiple classification methods using aerial photo and LiDAR datasets. The mean overall fuzzy accuracy across the EnviroAtlas communities is 88% and mean Kappa coefficient is 0.84. MULC is available in EnviroAtlas via web browser, web map service (WMS) in the user's geographic information system (GIS), and as downloadable data at EPA Environmental Data Gateway. Fact Sheets and metadata for each MULC Community are available through EnviroAtlas. Some MULC applications include mapping green and grey infrastructure, connecting land cover with socioeconomic/demographic variables, street tree planting, urban heat island analysis, mosquito habitat risk mapping and bikeway planning. This article provides practical guidance for using MULC effectively and developing similar high resolution (HR) land cover data.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Pilant, D., K.

",Contribution of Offshore Wind to the Power Grid: U.S. Air Quality Implications,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Offshore wind (OSW) is an established technology in Europe, but it has not yet gained market share in the United States (U.S.). There is, however, increasing interest in and action supporting OSW development from many coastal states, predominantly along the Atlantic coast. As OSW grows in the U.S., as seems likely, it will displace existing and future generation assets. Depending on the energy resources used by those generators, emissions from the electric power sector will change. This research explores combinations of two energy sector drivers, OSW costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation stringency, to measure the changes in the energy mix and quantify OSW's impact on the resulting emissions.

To this end, a novel attached growth anaerobic treatment system designed to emphasize the growth of the attached biofilm, rather than its removal, to optimize reactor performance. To accomplish this, a methane producing biofilm was developed on the shell side surface of submerged hollow fiber membranes, which allowed for immediate recovery of methane as it was produced, negating the liquid boundary layer and mass transfer fouling resistances. Impacts of membrane surface treatment on biofilm development were investigated as well.

",Mineralogical Evidence of Galvanic Corrosion in Drinking Water Lead Pipe Joints,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The importance of galvanic corrosion as a mechanism of toxic lead release into drinking water has been under scientific debate in the U.S. for over 30 years. Visual and mineralogical analysis of 28 lead pipe joints, excavated after 60+ years by 8 U.S water utilities, provided the first direct view of galvanic corrosion presence/extent in practice. Three patterns were observed: (1) no galvanic corrosion, (2) galvanic corrosion with lead pipe cathodic relative to anodic copper/brass, (3) galvanic corrosion with lead pipe anodic relative to cathodic copper/brass. Pattern 3 is consistent with the order of increasing nobility found in empirical galvanic series (lead, brass, copper). Pattern 2 is consistent with galvanic battery reversion, possibly depending on certain water quality and/or flow conditions. A variety of copper-sulfate minerals (Pattern 2), and lead-sulfate and lead -chloride minerals (Pattern 3) were identified to form in the galvanic zones, with geochemical modeling confirming the required pH drop from the bulk water level to pH 3.0-4.0 (Pattern 2) and pH<5.5 (Pattern 3), as well as the migration of chloride and sulfate ions toward the sacrificial anode. Despite joints being over 60 years old, galvanic zones in Pattern 3 were active and possibly posed an important source of lead to drinking water. This dataset is not publicly accessible because: Overall, due to the nature of this observational research, no additional datasets would be useful to provide to the public.

",Supplementary material for Lee et al. in review: Harmonization and Revision of a National Diatom Dataset for Use in the Development of Water Quality Indicators,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"ABSTRACT Diatom data have been collected in large-scale biological assessments in the United States, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA). However, the effectiveness of diatoms as indicators may suffer if inconsistent taxon identifications across different analysts obscure the relationships between assemblage composition and environmental variables. To reduce these inconsistencies, we harmonized the 2008-2009 NRSA data from nine analysts by updating names to current synonyms and by statistically identifying taxa with high analyst signal (taxa with more variation in relative abundance explained by the analyst factor, relative to environmental variables). We then screened a subset of samples with QA/QC data and combined taxa with mismatching identifications by the primary and secondary analysts. When these combined ""slash groups"" did not reduce analyst signal, we elevated taxa to the genus level or omitted taxa in difficult species complexes. We examined the variability explained by analyst in the original and revised datasets. Further, we examined how revising the datasets to reduce analyst signal can reduce inconsistency, thereby uncovering the variation in assemblage composition explained by total phosphorus (TP), an environmental variable of high priority for water managers. To produce a revised dataset with the greatest taxonomic consistency, we ultimately made 124 slash groups, omitted 7 taxa in the small naviculoid (e.g., Sellaphora atomoides) species complex, and elevated Nitzschia, Diploneis, and Tryblionella taxa to the genus level. Relative to the original dataset, the revised dataset had more overlap among samples grouped by analyst in ordination space, less variation explained by the analyst factor, and more than double the variation in assemblage composition explained by TP. Elevating all taxa to the genus level did not eliminate analyst signal completely, and analyst remained the most important predictor for the genera Sellaphora, Mayamaea, and Psammodictyon, indicating that these taxa present the greatest obstacle to consistent identification in this dataset. Although our process did not completely remove the analyst signal, this work clarifies the extent of the problem and provides a method to minimize analyst signal. Resolution of these taxonomic issues makes large datasets such as the NRSA more suitable for the development of diatom-based water quality indicators. This dataset is associated with the following publication: Lee, S., I. Bishop, S. Spaulding, R. Mitchell, and L. Yuan.

",Supplementary material for Lee et al. 2019 Taxonomic harmonization may reveal a stronger association between diatom assemblages and total phosphorus in large datasets,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Diatom data have been collected in large-scale biological assessments in the United States, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA). However, the effectiveness of diatoms as indicators may suffer if inconsistent taxon identifications across different analysts obscure the relationships between assemblage composition and environmental variables. To reduce these inconsistencies, we harmonized the 2008-2009 NRSA data from nine analysts by updating names to current synonyms and by statistically identifying taxa with high analyst signal (taxa with more variation in relative abundance explained by the analyst factor, relative to environmental variables). We then screened a subset of samples with QA/QC data and combined taxa with mismatching identifications by the primary and secondary analysts. When these combined ""slash groups"" did not reduce analyst signal, we elevated taxa to the genus level or omitted taxa in difficult species complexes. We examined the variation explained by analyst in the original and revised datasets. Further, we examined how revising the datasets to reduce analyst signal can reduce inconsistency, thereby uncovering the variation in assemblage composition explained by total phosphorus (TP), an environmental variable of high priority for water managers. To produce a revised dataset with the greatest taxonomic consistency, we ultimately made 124 slash groups, omitted 7 taxa in the small naviculoid (e.g., Sellaphora atomoides) species complex, and elevated Nitzschia, Diploneis, and Tryblionella taxa to the genus level. Relative to the original dataset, the revised dataset had more overlap among samples grouped by analyst in ordination space, less variation explained by the analyst factor, and more than double the variation in assemblage composition explained by TP. Elevating all taxa to the genus level did not eliminate analyst signal completely, and analyst remained the most important predictor for the genera Sellaphora, Mayamaea, and Psammodictyon, indicating that these taxa present the greatest obstacle to consistent identification in this dataset. Although our process did not completely remove analyst signal, this work provides a method to minimize analyst signal and improve detection of diatom association with TP in large datasets involving multiple analysts. Examination of variation in assemblage data explained by analyst and taxonomic harmonization may be necessary steps for improving data quality and the utility of diatoms as indicators of environmental variables.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Lee, S., I.

",Source Strength Functions from Long-Term Monitoring Data and Spatially Distributed Mass Discharge Measurements,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Source strength functions (SSF), defined as contaminant mass discharge or flux-averaged concentration from dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zones as a function of time, provide a quantitative model of DNAPL source-zone behavior. Such information is useful for making site management decisions. We investigate the use of historic data collected during long-term monitoring (LTM) activities at a site in Rhode Island to predict the SSF based on temporal mass discharge measurements at a fixed location, as well as SSF estimation using mass discharge measurements at a fixed time from three spatially distributed control planes. Mass discharge based on LTM data decreased from ~300 g/day in 1996 to ~70 g/day in 2012 at a control plane downgradient of the suspected DNAPL source zone, and indicates an overall decline of ~80% in 16 years. These measurements were compared to current mass discharge measurements across three spatially distributed control planes. Results indicate that mass discharge increased in the downgradient direction, and was ~6 g/day, ~37 g/day, and ~400 g/day at near, intermediate, and far distances from the suspected source zone, respectively. This behavior was expected given the decreasing trend observed in the LTM data at a fixed location. These two data sets were compared using travel time as a means to plot the data sets on a common axis. The similarity between the two data sets gives greater confidence to the use of this combined data set for site-specific SSF estimation relative to either the sole use of LTM or spatially distributed data sets.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Brooks, M.C., A.L.

All five fused-MAHCs, naphthalene (NAFT), fluorene (FE), Fluoranthene (FAT), pyrene (PY), and 9,10-dihydroanthracene (DAC) had no estrogenic activity in the in vitro assays used. Five of the eight bridged-MAHCs, triphenylethylene (3PE), o-terphenyl (OTP), triphenylmethane (TPM), 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE), and cis-stilbene (CSB) were estrogenic in these assays. The additional three bridged-MAHC's, trans-stilbene (TSB), tetraphenylethylene (4PE), and 4,4-di-tertbutylphenyl (DtBB) were determined to be non-binders due to isomeric configuration, solubility limitation, and possible steric hinderance.

",Chronic Toxicity of Major Ion Salts and Their Mixtures to Ceriodaphnia dubia,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This effort involved intensive chronic toxicity testing of major ion salts (comprised of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4, HCO3/CO3) with the cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia, a species known to be relatively sensitive to ion enrichment. This is the fourth in a series of manuscripts discussing the sensitivity of this species to major ions, with a specific focus of determining whether the principles governing acute response of this species to major ions also predict chronic responses. Results show this to be true, with acute-chronic ratios that are fairly consistent across different major ions, and responses to binary mixtures that show the same types of joint toxicity profiles as was observed previously for acute toxicity of major ions to this species. Mathematical models describing the response of these organisms were developed to predict the toxicity of major ion mixtures based on either chemical activity or chemical concentrations of ions in the mixture. These models showed good agreement with independent literature data on the chronic toxicity of major ion salts or ion mixtures to C. dubia. The datasets associated with this effort provide effect concentrations (EC20 and EC50) for 60 chronic toxicity tests conducted as part of this research, along with literature data extracted for comparison with model predictions. Data generated in this effort will inform efforts by OW, Regions, States, and Tribes to develop water quality standards/criteria for specific major ions (e.g., Cl, SO4). Perhaps more importantly, it provides part of the necessary scientific underpinning for developing standards/criteria that are sensitive to the specific composition of different sources of ion enrichment (e.g., produced water, mine drainage, irrigation return, industrial/municipal effluents) and can therefore support development of robust, integrated assessment tools.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Mount, D., R.

",State-Level Drivers of Future Fine Particulate Matter Mortality in the United States,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Future fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and health impacts will be largely determined by factors such as energy use, fuel choices, emission controls, state and national policies, and demographics. In this study, a human-earth system model is used to estimate US state-level PM2.5 mortality costs from 2015 to 2050 considering current major air quality and energy regulations. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index is applied to quantify the contributions of socioeconomic and energy factors to future changes in PM2.5 mortality costs. National PM2.5 mortality costs are estimated to decrease by 25% from 2015 to 2050, primarily driven by decreases in energy intensity and decreases in PM2.5 mortality cost per unit consumption of electric sector coal and transportation liquids. These factors together contribute to 68% of the net decrease, primarily because of technology improvements and air pollutant emission regulations. Furthermore, the results suggest that states with greater population and economic growth, but with fewer clean energy resources, are more likely to face significant challenges in reducing future PM2.5 mortality costs. In contrast, states with larger projected decreases in mortality costs have smaller increases in population and per capita GDP and greater decreases in electric sector coal share and PM2.5 mortality cost per unit fuel consumption.

To address legacy PFAS concerns in the US, industry developed numerous replacement PFAS that commonly are treated as confidential information. To investigate the distribution of PFAS in New Jersey (NJ), soils collected from across the state were subjected to nontargeted mass-spectral analyses. Ten chloro-perfluoro-polyether-carboxylates were tentatively identified, with >=3 congeners in all samples. Nine congeners are >=(CF2)7. Distinct chemical formulas and structures, as well as geographic distribution, suggest airborne transport from an industrial source. Lighter congeners dispersed more widely than heavier, with the most widely dispersed detected in an in-stock New Hampshire sample.

",Maternal High Fat Diet Modify Offspring Susceptibility to Inhaled Ozone-Induced Systemic Metabolic Alterations,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Maternal high-fat diet (HFD) and obesity can increase the susceptibility of offspring to inhaled pollutants. In this study, we examined the influence of maternal HFD on metabolic responses to ozone in young Long-Evans rat offspring. F0-females began control (CD, 10%kcal from fat) or high-fat diet (HFD, 60%kcal from fat) at post-natal day (PND)-30. Rats were bred on PND-72 and allowed to give birth. Dietary regimen was maintained until PND-30 and then all offspring were switched to CD. On PND-40, female and male offspring-F1 (n=10/group) were exposed to air or 0.8-ppm ozone for 5h and within 1h serum samples were collected for neuroendocrine hormones and global metabolomic analysis. Offspring from HFD-dams had increased body fat and weight relative to CD, however, no major changes in circulating hormones were noted. Metabolomic analysis revealed significant sex, diet, and exposure-related changes in metabolites. Maternal HFD increased free fatty acids and decreased phospholipids (female>male). Also, microbiome-associated histidine and tyrosine metabolites were increased in both sexes of offspring, while 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels decreased in males. Ozone exposure increased free fatty acids in males from CD-dams but decreased in females from HFD-dams. Ozone also decreased monohydroxy fatty acids and acyl carnitines in females (HFD>CD). Moreover, it increased pyruvate along with TCA cycle intermediates in females suggesting an increase in glucose utilization. Ozone increased various amino acids, polyamines and metabolites of gut microbiota in HFD female offspring. Collectively, these data suggest that maternal HFD increases offspring susceptibility to metabolic alterations in a sex-specific manner when challenged with environmental stressors.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Snow, S., K.

",Metadata entry - Inferring changes in summertime surface ozone NOx-VOC chemistry over U.S. urban areas from two decades of satellite and ground-based observations,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Urban ozone (O3) formation can be limited by NOx, VOCs, or both, complicating the design of effective O3 abatement plans. A satellite-retrieved ratio of formaldehyde to NO2 (HCHO/NO2), developed from theory and modeling, has previously been used to indicate O3 formation chemistry. Here, we connect this space-based indicator to spatiotemporal variations in O3 recorded by on-the-ground monitors over major U.S. cities. High-O3 events vary nonlinearly with OMI HCHO and NO2, and the transition from VOC-limited to NOx-limited O3 formation regimes occurs at higher HCHO/NO2 value (3 to 4) than previously determined from models, with slight intercity variations. To extend satellite records back to 1996, we develop an approach to harmonize observations from GOME and SCIAMACHY that accounts for differences in spatial resolution and overpass time. Two-decade (1996-2016) multisatellite HCHO/NO2 captures the timing and location of the transition from VOC-limited to NOx-limited O3 production regimes in major U.S. cities, which aligns with the observed long-term changes in urban-rural gradient of O3 and the reversal of O3 weekend effect. Our findings suggest promise for applying space-based HCHO/NO2 to interpret local O3 chemistry, particularly with the new-generation satellite instruments that offer finer spatial and temporal resolution.

1038,"https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/a-multiphase-cmaq-version-5-0-adjoint
",A multiphase CMAQ version 5.0 adjoint,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"We present the development of a multiphase adjoint for the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, a widely used chemical transport model. The adjoint model provides location- and time-specific gradients that can be used in various applications such as backward sensitivity analysis, source attribution, optimal pollution control, data assimilation, and inverse modeling. The science processes of the CMAQ model include gas-phase chemistry, aerosol dynamics and thermodynamics, cloud chemistry and dynamics, diffusion, and advection. Discrete adjoints are implemented for all the science processes, with an additional continuous adjoint for advection. The development of discrete adjoints is assisted with algorithmic differentiation (AD) tools. Particularly, the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP) is implemented for gas-phase and aqueous chemistry, and two different automatic differentiation tools are used for other processes such as clouds, aerosols, diffusion, and advection. The continuous adjoint of advection is developed manually. For adjoint validation, the brute-force or finite-difference method (FDM) is implemented process by process with box- or column-model simulations. Due to the inherent limitations of the FDM caused by numerical round-off errors, the complex variable method (CVM) is adopted where necessary. The adjoint model often shows better agreement with the CVM than with the FDM. The adjoints of all science processes compare favorably with the FDM and CVM. In an example application of the full multiphase adjoint model, we provide the first estimates of how emissions of particulate matter (PM2.5) affect public health across the US.

",Characterization of Aerosol Nitro Aromatic Compounds Validation of an Experimental Method,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The analytical capabilities associated with the use of silylation reactions have been extended to a new class of organic molecules, nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). These compounds are a possible contributor to urban particulate matter of secondary origin which would make them important analytes due to their (1) detrimental health effects, (2) potential to affect aerosol optical properties, (3) and usefulness for identifying PM2.5 from biomass burning. The technique is based on derivatization of the parent NACs using N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoro acetamide, one of the most prevalent derivatization reagent for analyzing hydroxylated molecules, followed by GC-MS using electron ionization (EI) and methane chemical ionization (CI). This method is evaluated for 32 NACs including nitrophenols, methyl-/methoxy-nitrophenols, nitrobenzoic acids, and nitrobenzyl alcohols. EI spectra were characterized by a high abundance of ions corresponding to [M+.], or [M+ - 15]. CI spectra exhibited high abundance for [M+ + 1], [M+ - 15], and [M+ + 29] ions. Both EI and CI spectra exhibit ions specific to nitro group(s) for [M+. - 31], [M+. - 45], and [M+. - 60]. The strong abundance observed for [M+.] (EI), [M+ - 15] (EI/CI), or [M+ + 1] (CI) ions is consistent with the high charge stabilizing ability associated with aromatic compounds. The combination of EI and CI ionization offers strong capabilities for detection and identification of NACs. Spectra associated with NACs, containing hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms only, as silylated derivatives show fragment/adduct ions at either (a) odd or (b) even masses that indicate either (a) odd or (b) even number of nitro groups, respectively. Mass spectra associated with silylated NACs exhibited three distinct regions where characteristic fragmentation with a specific pattern associated with: (1) -OH, and/or -COOH groups, (2) -NO2 group(s), and (3) benzene ring(s). These findings were confirmed with applications to chamber aerosol and ambient PM2.5.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Jaoui, M., M. Lewandowski, J. Offenberg, M. Colon, K.

This is a national county-level database of cancer data that are collected by state public health surveillance systems. All-site cancer is defined as any type of cancer that is captured in the state registry data, though non-melanoma skin cancer is not included. All-site age-adjusted cancer incidence rates were abstracted separately for males and females. County-level annual age-adjusted all-site cancer incidence rates for years 2006-2010 were available for 2687 of 3142 (85.5%) counties in the U.S. Counties for which there are fewer than 16 reported cases in a specific area-sex-race category are suppressed to ensure confidentiality and stability of rate estimates, this accounted for 14 counties in our study. Two states, Kansas and Virginia, do not provide data because of state legislation and regulations which prohibit the release of county level data to outside entities. Data from Michigan does not include cases diagnosed in other states because data exchange agreements prohibit the release of data to third parties. Finally, state data is not available for three states, Minnesota, Ohio, and Washington. The age-adjusted average annual incidence rate for all counties was 453.7 per 100,000 persons. We selected 2006-2010 as it is subsequent in time to the EQI exposure data which was constructed to represent the years 2000-2005. We also gathered data for the three leading causes of cancer for males (lung, prostate, and colorectal) and females (lung, breast, and colorectal).The EQI was used as an exposure metric as an indicator of cumulative environmental exposures at the county-level representing the period 2000 to 2005. A complete description of the datasets used in the EQI are provided in Lobdell et al. and methods used for index construction are described by Messer et al. The EQI was developed for the period 2000- 2005 because it was the time period for which the most recent data were available when index construction was initiated. The EQI includes variables representing each of the environmental domains. The air domain includes 87 variables representing criteria and hazardous air pollutants. The water domain includes 80 variables representing overall water quality, general water contamination, recreational water quality, drinking water quality, atmospheric deposition, drought, and chemical contamination.

",Associations between environmental quality and mortality in the contiguous United States 2000-2005,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Age-adjusted mortality rates for the contiguous United States in 2000-2005 were obtained from the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research system of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (2015). Age-adjusted mortality rates were weighted averages of the age-specific death rates, and they were used to account for different age structures among populations (Curtin and Klein 1995). The mortality rates for counties with < 10 deaths were suppressed by the CDC to protect privacy and to ensure data reliability, only counties with >= 10 deaths were included in the analyses. The underlying cause of mortality was specified using the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (10th revision, ICD-10). In this study, we focused on the all-cause mortality rate (A00-R99) and on mortality rates from the three leading causes: heart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20-I51), cancer (C00-C97), and stroke (I60- I69) (Heron 2013). We excluded mortality due to external causes for all-cause mortality, as has been done in many previous studies (e.g., Pearce et al. 2010, 2011, Zanobetti and Schwartz 2009), because external causes of mortality are less likely to be related to environmental quality. We also focused on the contiguous United States because the numbers of counties with available cause-specific mortality rates were small in Hawaii and Alaska. County-level rates were available for 3,101 of the 3,109 counties in the contiguous United States (99.7%) for all-cause mortality, for 3,067 (98.6%) counties for heart disease mortality, for 3,057 (98.3%) counties for cancer mortality, and for 2,847 (91.6%) counties for stroke mortality.

This meta-analysis summarizes relationships between coastal habitats and final ecosystem goods and services (FEGS) users. Through a ""weight of evidence"" approach synthesizing information from published literature, we assessed habitat classes most relevant to coastal users. Approximately 2800 coastal EGS journal articles were identified by online search engines, of which 16% addressed linkages between specific coastal habitats and FEGS users, and were retained for subsequent analysis. Recreational (83%) and industrial (35%) users were most cited in literature, with experiential-users/hikers and commercial fishermen most prominent in each category, respectively. Recreational users were linked to the widest diversity of coastal habitat subclasses (i.e., 22 of 26). Whereas, mangroves and emergent wetlands were most relevant for property owners. We urge EGS studies to continue surveying local users and identifying habitat dependencies, as these steps are important precursors for developing appropriate coastal FEGS metrics and facilitating local valuation. In addition, understanding how habitats contribute to human well-being may assist communities in prioritizing restoration and evaluating development scenarios in the context of future ecosystem service delivery.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Littles, C., C.

",Dataset 1: Studies included in literature review,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This dataset contains the results of a literature review of experimental nutrient addition studies to determine which nutrient forms were most often measured in the scientific literature. To obtain a representative selection of relevant studies, we searched Web of Science(tm) using a search string to target experimental studies in artificial and natural lotic systems while limiting irrelevant papers. We screened the titles and abstracts of returned papers for relevance (experimental studies in streams/stream mesocosms that manipulated nutrients). To supplement this search, we sorted the relevant articles from the Web of Science(tm) search alphabetically by author and sequentially examined the bibliographies for additional relevant articles (screening titles for relevance, and then screening abstracts of potentially relevant articles) until we had obtained a total of 100 articles. If we could not find a relevant article electronically, we moved to the next article in the bibliography. Our goal was not to be completely comprehensive, but to obtain a fairly large sample of published, peer-reviewed studies from which to assess patterns. We excluded any lentic or estuarine studies from consideration and included only studies that used mesocosms mimicking stream systems (flowing water or stream water source) or that manipulated nutrient concentrations in natural streams or rivers. We excluded studies that used nutrient diffusing substrate (NDS) because these manipulate nutrients on substrates and not in the water column. We also excluded studies examining only nutrient uptake, which rely on measuring dissolved nutrient concentrations with the goal of characterizing in-stream processing (e.g., Newbold et al., 1983). From the included studies, we extracted or summarized the following information: study type, study duration, nutrient treatments, nutrients measured, inclusion of TN and/or TP response to nutrient additions, and a description of how results were reported in relation to the research-management mismatch, if it existed.

",Data for organotypic stem cell model for human embryonic palatal fusion.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Cleft palate (CP) is a common birth defect, occurring in an estimated 1 in 1000 births worldwide. The secondary palate is formed by paired palatal shelves that grow toward each other, appose, attach and fuse. CP can result from disruption of any of these processes. The palatal shelves basically consist of a mesenchymal tissue core covered with a layer of epithelial cells. One of the mechanisms that can cause CP is failure of fusion, i.e., failure to remove the epithelial seam between the palatal shelves to allow the mesenchyme to merge and form a continuous palate. This process requires complex interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells, and signaling components such as growth factors. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in palate growth and differentiation, while it may impede fusion. We developed a 3D organotypic model using human mesenchymal and epithelial stem cells to mimic human embryonic palatal shelves, and tested its functional relevance by monitoring the effects of human EGF (hEGF) on proliferation and fusion. Spheroids were generated from human umbilical-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) directed down an osteogenic lineage by culture medium and evaluated for osteogenic differentiation. Heterotypic spheroids, or organoids, were constructed by coating hMSC spheroids with MaxGel(tm) extracellular matrix solution followed by a layer of human progenitor epithelial keratinocytes (hPEK). Organoids were incubated in co-culture medium with or without hEGF and assessed for cell proliferation and spheroid pairs were assessed for time to fusion. Osteogenic differentiation in hMSC spheroids was highest by day 13. hEGF delayed fusion of heterotypic organoids after 12 and 18 hours of contact. hEGF increased proliferation in organoids at 4 ng/ml, and proliferation was detected in hPEKs alone on microcarrier beads, suggesting a potential mechanism for delayed fusion by hEGF. Our results show that this model of human palatal fusion consisting of a core of differentiated hMSCs with a hPEK outer layer appropriately mimics the morphology of the developing human palate and responds to hEGF as expected. Future studies will focus on using the organoid model to evaluate the effects of teratogenic chemicals on palatal fusion, and validating the results.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Wolf, C., D.

",Differential Sensitivity to In Vitro Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 Aromatase (CYP19) Activity Among 18 Freshwater Fishes,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"There is significant concern regarding potential impairment of fish reproduction associated with endocrine disrupting chemicals. Aromatase (CYP19) is a steroidogenic enzyme involved in the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Inhibition of aromatase by chemicals can result in reduced concentrations of estrogens leading to adverse reproductive effects. These effects have been extensively investigated in a small number of laboratory model fishes, but differences in sensitivity among species is largely unknown. Therefore, this study took a first step towards understanding potential differences in sensitivity to aromatase inhibitors among fishes. Specifically, a standard in vitro aromatase inhibition assay using subcellular fractions of whole tissue homogenates was used to evaluate the potential sensitivity of eighteen phylogenetically diverse species of freshwater fish to the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor fadrozole. Sensitivity to fadrozole ranged by more than 52-fold among these species. Five species were further investigated for sensitivity to up to four additional nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, letrozole, imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole. Potencies of each of these chemicals relative to fadrozole ranged by up to two orders of magnitude among the five species. Commonly investigated laboratory model species were among the least sensitive to all the investigated chemicals, therefore, ecological risks of aromatase inhibitors derived from these species might not be adequately protective of more sensitive native fishes. This information could guide more objective ecological risk assessments of native fishes to chemicals that inhibit aromatase.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Doering, J., D. Villeneuve, K. Fay, E. Randolph, K. Jensen, M. Kahl, C. LaLone, and G. Ankley.

We modeled mosquito trap counts using a Bayesian hierarchical mixed-effects model with spatially correlated residuals. The models indicated an inverse relationship between temperature and mosquito trap counts for both species, which may be due to the hot and arid climate of southern Texas. The temporal trend in mosquito populations indicated Ae. aegypti populations peaking in the late spring and Ae. albopictus reaching a maximum in winter.

","Secondary Organic Aerosols from Aromatic Hydrocarbons and their Contribution to Fine Particulate Matter in Atlanta, Georgia",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Tracers of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from thirteen aromatic hydrocarbons were quantified in laboratory smog chamber experiments. Class-specific SOA tracers emerged, including 2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxo-pentatonic acid (DHOPA) from monoaromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phthalic acid from naphthalene and 1-methylnaphthalene, and methyl-nitrocatechol isomers from o,m,p-cresol oxidation. Organic carbon mass fractions (fSOC) for these and other tracers were determined and extend the SOA tracer method widely used to apportion biogenic SOC. The extended SOA tracer model was applied to evaluate the sources of SOC in Atlanta, GA during summer 2015 and winter 2016 after modifying the chamber-derived fSOC! values to reflect SOA yields and local VOC levels (fSOC'). Monoaromatic, diaromatic, and cresol SOC contributed an average of 24%, 8%, and 0.12% of organic carbon (OC) mass during summer and 17%, 5%, and 0.27% during winter, respectively. Cresol SOC peaked during winter and was highly correlated with levoglucosan (r=0.93, p<0.001), consistent with it originating from biomass burning. Together, aromatic, biogenic, and biomass burning derived SOC accounted for an average of 77% and 28% of OC in summer and winter, respectively. The new understanding of SOA composition from aromatic VOCs advances the tracer-based method by including important precursors of SOC and enables a better understanding of the sources of atmospheric aerosol.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Al-Naiema, I.M., J.

This study evaluated the utility of a simple AOP network to predict the interactive effects of a binary chemical mixture comprised of an inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme (fadrozole, a human pharmaceutical) and an agonist of the androgen receptor (trenbolone, a veterinary drug). Overall, prediction of interactive effects of the two chemicals based on the AOP network did not match actual observed effects.

",Saunders et al._Dietary bioaccumulation and biotransformation of hydrophobic organic sunscreen agents in rainbow trout,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Organic ultraviolet filters (UVFs, also known as sunscreen agents) used in personal care and consumer products can enter the aquatic environment via wastewater treatment plant effluents or by loss from skin during swimming and other recreational activities. Some UVFs are hydrophobic (log Kow > 4) which has led to concern that they may bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of two widely-used UVFs, 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and octocrylene (OCT) in rainbow trout exposed via the diet. EHMC and OCT were significantly metabolized by trout and this metabolism substantially reduced bioaccumulation relative to levels observed for a set of poorly transformed chemicals having similar log Kow values. Derived bioconcentration factors (BCFs) and biomagnification factors (BMFs) for both UVFs were well below established bioaccumulation criteria, suggesting that EHMC and OCT are unlikely to pose a bioaccumulation hazard in trout. This research substantially increases existing knowledge concerning the fate and effects of UVFs in the environment.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Saunders, L., A.

It further introduces a separate recovery experiment, using SRM 2585, designed to shed light on factors that affect analyte loss during extraction, cleanup, instrumental analysis, and data processing. Many compounds have been measured and reported in SRM 2585 to date, cross-referencing these compounds against those detected via NTA provides a unique means with which to critically evaluate NTA performance in a real-world context. The recovery experiment described herein further informs factors (e.g., matrix, extraction procedures) that influence compound identification using NTA. Finally, by analyzing the same mixture of compounds at different concentrations and in the presence and absence of dust matrix, the performance of NTA is evaluated here from a quantitative perspective, rather than a typical qualitative perspective.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Newton, S., J.

The system was not performing to design standards and best management practices. To research wet-weather capture and aquifer recharge, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contracted GeoSystems Analysis, Inc. (GSA) to supervise the drilling and installation of a vadose zone testing well (Test Well) and a groundwater monitoring well (Monitor Well) at the Sleepy Hollow drywell site at Fort Irwin. Additionally, GSA contracted Torrent Resources Inc. (Phoenix, AZ) (Torrent Resources) to upgrade the drywell site.The Test Well was instrumented with water and air piezometers to allow testing of the infiltration capacity of the on-site basin fill deposits and derive hydraulic conductivity properties for these materials through intermediate and large-scale field testing and laboratory testing. Water piezometers were used to conduct borehole permeameter tests to provide an estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) at the testing intervals. Air piezometers were used to conduct atmospheric pressure wave testing, which measures the bulk air permeability of vadose zone sediments in the vicinity of the well. Air permeability estimates can then be converted to estimates of water permeability. A water level and temperature sensor was also installed in one of the water piezometers to measure the depth of perched groundwater.The Monitor Well was drilled to depths reaching the groundwater table to monitor the performance of the new drywell system. The Monitor Well also included a shallow piezometer installed above a low-permeability fine-grained sediment layer. Water level and temperature sensors were installed to measure the depth to groundwater and depth of perched water above the fine-grained layers. In addition, soil water content, electrical conductivity, and temperature sensors were installed at various depths in the vadose zone to monitor advancement of wetting fronts.","Enviromental Data,Soil Health Data",Enviromental Data,Soil Health Data,,,,,,,,,,,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD)'s dataset - 'Fort Irwin Test Well and Monitor Well Installation Report' provides Enviromental Data and Soil Health Data.

The Marietta/Mount Vernon data collection took place in August, 2009 as this was the original study location. Marietta was an air manganese (air-Mn) exposed community and Mt. Vernon was a comparison community believed to have little or no air-Mn exposure. After receiving additional funding and approvals, East Liverpool was added and data collection occurred in November, 2011 using identical study protocols to the Marietta/Mount Vernon study with the exception of additional specimen collections of hair and toenails (only collected in East Liverpool). All participants underwent a neuropsychological battery of tests of mood, motor and cognitive function. A comprehensive health questionnaire was administered inquiring about sociodemographics, symptoms, diagnosed illnesses, medication use, health habits, work history, and dietary consumption (used to compute dietary intake of Mn and Fe). Additionally, the study included data acquisition on air monitoring and modeling, biomarkers, and health.

",Data for 3D Organoid Model Assessment of Influence of Chemicals on Morphogenetic Fusion.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Organogenesis in the embryo involves cell differentiation and organization events that are unique to each tissue and organ and are susceptible to developmental toxicants. Animal models are the gold standard for identifying putative teratogens, but the limited throughput of developmental toxicological studies in animals coupled with the limited concordance between animal and human teratogenicity motivates a different approach. In vitro organoid models can mimic the cellular architecture and phenotype of many tissues and organs, and the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of organoids presents an opportunity to study developmental human toxicology. Common themes during development like the involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tissue fusion present an opportunity to develop in vitro models to study cell and tissue morphogenesis. We previously described organoids composed of human stem and progenitor cells that recapitulated the cellular features of palate fusion, and here we further characterized the model by examining pharmacological inhibitors targeting known palatogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis pathways as well as twelve cleft palate teratogens identified from rodent models. Organoid survival was dependent on signaling through EGF, IGF, HGF, and FGF pathways, and organoid fusion was disrupted by inhibition of BMP signaling. We observed concordance between the effects of EGF, FGF, and BMP inhibitors on organoid fusion and epithelial cell migration in vitro, suggesting that organoid fusion is dependent on epithelial morphogenesis. Three of the twelve putative cleft palate teratogens studied here significantly disrupted in vitro fusion, including theophylline, triamcinolone, and valproic acid. Tributyltin chloride and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) were cytotoxic to fusing organoids. The study herein demonstrates the utility of the in vitro fusion assay for identifying chemicals that disrupt human organoid survival and morphogenesis in a scalable format amenable to toxicology screening.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Belair, D., C.

We characterized the CCES by exposing indigo dye-impregnated filters inside each culture well to 125 ppb ozone (O3) for 1 h at flow rates of 5 and 25 mL/min/well, the reaction of O3 with an indigo dye produces a fluorescence product. We observed a 5-fold increase in fluorescence at 25 mL/min/well, suggesting higher flows were more effective. We then exposed primary human bronchial lung epithelial cells (HBECs) to 0.3 ppm acrolein for 2 h at 3, 5 and 25 mL/min/well and compared our results against well-established Human Studies Facility in vitro exposure chambers (HSF Chambers) at the U.S. EPA. We measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and transcript changes of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) and interleukin-8 (IL8) at 0, 1, and 24 h post-exposure. Comparing responses from the HSF Chamber to the CCES, differences were only observed at 1 h post-exposure for HMOX1. Here, the HSF Chamber produced a ~6-fold increase in HMOX1 while the CCES at 3 and 5 mL/min/well produced a ~1.7-fold increase. Operating the CCES at 25 mL/min/well produced a ~4.5-fold increase, slightly lower than the HSF Chamber. Our results suggest that higher flow rates in the CCES were more effective at delivering the gas to the cells, and this was further validated by our comparison against a well-established in vitro exposure system. Further testing is required to explore the sensitivity of the CCES with other chemicals.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Zavala-Mendez, J., A. Ledbetter, D.S. Morgan, L.

",Vascular response to ultrafine particulate matter in superoxide dismutase 2 deficient mouse aortas,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Studies have linked exposure to ultrafine particulate matter (PM) and adverse cardiovascular events. Particulate matter-induced oxidative stress is believed to be a key mechanism underlying observed adverse vascular effects. Advanced age is one factor known to decrease anti-oxidant defenses and confer susceptibility to the detrimental vascular effects seen following PM exposure. The present study was designed to investigate the vasomotor responses following ultrafine PM exposure in wild type (WT) and superoxide dismutase 2 deficient (SOD2+/-) mice which possess decreased anti-oxidant defense. Thoracic aortic rings isolated from young and aged WT and SOD2+/- mice were exposed to ultrafine PM in a tissue bath system. Aortic rings were then constricted with increasing concentrations of phenylephrine, followed by relaxation with rising amounts of nitroglycerin (NTG). Data demonstrated that ultrafine PM decreased the relaxation response in both young WT and young SOD2+/- mouse aortas, and relaxation was significantly reduced in young SOD2+/- compared to WT mice. Ultrafine PM significantly diminished the NTG-induced relaxation response in aged compared to young mouse aortas. After ultrafine PM exposure, the relaxation response did not differ markedly between aged WT and aged SOD2+/- mice. Data demonstrate that the greater vascular effect in aortic rings in aged mice ex vivo after ultrafine PM exposure may be attributed to ultrafine PM-induced oxidative stress and loss of anti-oxidant defenses in aged vascular tissue. Consistent with this conclusion is the attenuation of NTG-induced relaxation response in young SOD2+/- mice.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Carter, J., N. Madamanchi , G.

The probabilistic design was the first step toward establishing a long-term monitoring program for biological water quality standards (such as biocriteria) in Puerto Rico using these indicators. The target population was limited to coral reef and hardbottom substrate within 1.5 km o f shore and between 2-12 m depth. Divers dropped a buoy at the appropriate station coordinates and assessed the reef resources at the best available habitat within a 20 m radius of the buoy.

",Trends in the oxidation and relative volatility of chamber-generated secondary organic aerosol,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The relationship between the oxidation state and relative volatility of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from the oxidation of a wide range of hydrocarbons is investigated using a fast-stepping, scanning thermodenuder interfaced with a high resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). SOA oxidation state varied widely across the investigated range of parent hydrocarbons but was relatively stable for replicate experiments using a single hydrocarbon precursor. On average, unit mass resolution indicators of SOA oxidation (e.g., AMS f43 and f44) are consistent with previously reported values. Linear regression of H:C vs O:C obtained from parameterization of f43 and f44 and elemental analysis of high resolution spectra in Van Krevelen space both yield a slope of ~0.5 across different SOA types. A similar slope was obtained for a distinct subset of toluene/NOx reactions in which the integrated oxidant exposure was varied to alter oxidation. The relative volatility of different SOA types displays similar variability and is strongly correlated with SOA oxidation state (OSC). On average, relatively low oxidation and volatility were observed for aliphatic alkene (including terpenes) and n-alkane SOA while the opposite is true for mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon SOA. Effective enthalpy for total chamber aerosol obtained from volatility differential mobility analysis is also highly correlated with OSC indicating a primary role for oxidation levels in determining the volatility of chamber SOA. Effective enthalpies for chamber SOA are substantially lower than those of neat organic standards but are on the order of those obtained for partially oligomerized glyoxal and methyl glyoxal.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Docherty, K., E.

Cardiac strain data, heart function and dimensions, and transmitral blood flow were investigated with echocardiography (40 MHz) before exposures, 1 day after the first exposure, and 1 day after the final exposure. Several other biological endpoints were evaluated but the key findings from ultrasound echocardiography assessments were: elapsed time between peak strain in adjacent wall segments (i.e. myocardial strain delay), a measure of myocardial dyssynchrony, increased by ~5-fold in B6129 mice after the final exposure to CAPs+Acrolein when compared to strain delay in B6129 mice exposed to FA, CAPs, or Acrolein alone, and when compared to strain delay in Trpa1-/- mice exposed to CAPs+Acrolein.

Vector autoregression analyses were completed to better understand important species influencing the formation of O3 and NOx. For the species studied, r2 values of predicted versus measured concentrations ranged from 0.82-0.99. Fitting parameters for the autoregressive matrix, Pi, indicated the importance of species precursors. In addition, values of fitting parameters for Pi were relatively insensitive to data size, with variations generally <10%. Variable causation was quantified using the Granger causation method.

The Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) is one of the most widely used water quality models and has recently been upgraded to WASP8. WASP8 incorporates the algorithms to simulate the fate and transport of nanoparticles in surface waters. This study simulates the fate and transport of graphene oxide (GO) nanomaterials and their major phototransformation product, photoreduced graphene oxide (rGO), for Brier Creek, GA, USA.

",Science Hub Sulfate Radicals,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Activated persulfate (PS) is a common method used to generate sulfate radicals (SO4*-), a powerful oxidant capable of degrading a broad array of environmental contaminants. The reaction of SO4*- with non-target species (i.e., scavenging), contributes significantly to treatment inefficiency. Radical scavenging in this manner has been quantified for non-target chemical species in the aqueous phase but has never been quantified for solid phase media. Kinetic analysis and laboratory methods were developed to quantify the SO4*- scavenging rate constant (kS) for alumina, a naturally occurring mineral in soil and aquifer materials. SO4*- were generated in UV- and thermally-activated persulfate (UV-APS, T-APS) batch systems, and the loss of rhodamine B (RhB) served as an indicator of SO4*- activity. kS for alumina was 2.42x104 m-2 s-1 and 2.03x104 m-2 s-1 for UV-APS and T-APS oxidative treatment systems, respectively. At [alumina] >5 g L-1, the reaction of SO4*- with solid phase media increased over the aqueous phase reactions with RhB and aqueous scavengers. SO4*- scavenging by solid surfaces was orders of magnitude greater than reaction with the target compound and scavengers in the aqueous phase, underscoring the significant role of solid surfaces in scavenging SO4*-.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Rusevova Crincoli, K., C.

",Data for Modeling lateral plume deflection in the wake of an elongated building,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The plume dispersion model AERMOD provides an efficient method for modeling ground-level pollutant concentrations in wakes of buildings. In recent years, several studies have shown that the downwash algorithms within AERMOD often perform poorly in certain applications. Some studies have proposed modifications to the downwash algorithm in AERMOD to bring the model closer to representing the underlying physical processes associated with building downwash and closer to more accurately modeling observed pollutant concentrations. One such study by Monbureau et al. (2018) made changes to the model that significantly improved its ability to model ground level concentrations for a simple case of a single rectangular building with an elevated, effluent-emitting stack experiencing winds perpendicular to the upwind side of the building. The present study introduces a simple algorithm to enhance AERMOD's ability to appropriately match the dispersion pattern in the complex flow case of non-orthogonal winds. This algorithm, which is based on a rich set of Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), applies to a variety of building dimensions, stack locations, and stack heights. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates how additional modifications to the downwash algorithm may further improve AERMOD in modeling the spatial location of observed ground-level effluent.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Monbureau, E.M., D.

",DLVO Modeling of Spores Dataset,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Development of numerical models to predict stormwater-mediated transport of pathogenic spores in the environment depends on an understanding of adhesion forces that dictate detachment after rain events. Zeta potential values were measured for Bacillus globgii and Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki, two common surrogates used to represent Bacillus anthracis, in synthetic baseline ultrapure water and laboratory stormwater. Zeta potential curves were also determined for materials representative of urban infrastructure (concrete and asphalt). These data were used to predict the interaction energy between the spores and urban materials using Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) modeling. B. globgii and B. thuringiensis kurstaki sourced from Yakibou Inc., were found to have similar zeta potential curves, whereas spores sourced from the U.S. military's Dugway laboratory were found to diverge. In the ultrapure water, the energy barriers between the spores and the urban materials were tunable through compression of the double layer of the spores via changes of ionic strength and pH of the water. In the runoff water, charge neutralization dominated surface processes. The cations, metals, and natural organic matter (NOM) in the runoff water contributed to equalizing the zeta potential values for Dugway B. globgii and B. thuringiensis kurstaki, and drastically modified the surface of the concrete and asphalt. All DLVO energy curves using the runoff water were repulsive. The highest energy barrier predicted in this study was for Dugway B. globgii spores interacting with a concrete surface in runoff water, suggesting that this would be the most challenging combination to detach through water-based decontamination.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Mikelonis, A., K.

",The association between environmental quality and diabetes in the U.S.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Population-based county-level estimates for diagnosed (DDP), undiagnosed (UDP), and total diabetes prevalence (TDP) were acquired from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) for the years 2004-2012 (Evaluation 2017). Prevalence estimates were calculated using a two-stage approach. The first stage used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to predict high fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels (>=126 mg/dL) and/or hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels (>=6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) based on self-reported demographic and behavioral characteristics (Dwyer-Lindgren, Mackenbach et al. 2016). This model was then applied to Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to impute high FPG and/or A1C status for each BRFSS respondent (Dwyer-Lindgren, Mackenbach et al. 2016). The second stage used the imputed BRFSS data to fit a series of small area models, which were used to predict the county-level prevalence of each of the diabetes-related outcomes (Dwyer-Lindgren, Mackenbach et al. 2016). Diagnosed diabetes was defined as the proportion of adults (age 20+ years) who reported a previous diabetes diagnosis, represented as an age-standardized prevalence percentage. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as proportion of adults (age 20+ years) who have a high FPG or HbA1C but did not report a previous diagnosis of diabetes. Total diabetes was defined as the proportion of adults (age 20+ years) who reported a previous diabetes diagnosis and/or had a high FPG/HbA1C. The age-standardized diabetes prevalence (%) was used as the outcome.The EQI was constructed for 2000-2005 for all US counties and is composed of five domains (air, water, built, land, and sociodemographic), each composed of variables to represent the environmental quality of that domain. Domain-specific EQIs were developed using principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce these variables within each domain while the overall EQI was constructed from a second PCA from these individual domains (L. C. Messer et al., 2014). To account for differences in environment across rural and urban counties, the overall and domain-specific EQIs were stratified by rural urban continuum codes (RUCCs) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2015).

","Intergenerational responses of wheat to CeO2 nanoparticles, growth and nutrient contents",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The intergenerational impact of engineered nanomaterials in plants is a key knowledge gap in the literature. A soil microcosm study was performed to assess the effects of multi-generational exposure of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2-NPs). Seeds from plants that were exposed to 0, 125, and 500 mg CeO2-NPs/kg soil (Ce-0, Ce-125 or Ce-500, respectively) in first generation (S1) were cultivated in factorial combinations of Ce-0, Ce-125 or Ce-500 to produce second generation (S2) plants. The factorial combinations for first/second generation treatments in Ce-125 were S1-Ce-0/S2-Ce-0, S1-Ce-0/S2-Ce-125, S1-Ce-125/S2-Ce-0 and S1-Ce-125/S2-Ce-125, and in Ce-500 were S1-Ce-0/S2-Ce-0, S1-Ce-0/S2-Ce-500, S1-Ce-500/S2-Ce-0 and S1-Ce-500/S2-Ce-500. Agronomic, elemental, isotopic, and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) data were collected on second generation plants. Results showed that plants treated during the first generation only with either Ce-125 or Ce-500 (e.g. S1-Ce-125/S2-Ce-0 or S1-Ce-500/S2-Ce-0) had reduced accumulation of Ce (61 or 50%), Fe (49 or 58%) and Mn (34 or 41%) in roots, and d15N (11 or 8%) in grains compared to the plants not treated in both generations (i.e. S1-Ce-0/S2-Ce-0). Plants treated in both generations with Ce-125 (i.e. S1-Ce-125/S2-Ce-125) produced grains that had lower Mn, Ca, K, Mg and P relative to plants treated in the second generation only (i.e. S1-Ce-0/S2-Ce-125). In addition, synchrotron XRF elemental chemistry maps of soil/plant thin-sections revealed limited transformation of CeO2-NPs with no evidence of plant uptake or accumulation. The findings demonstrated that first generation exposure of wheat to CeO2-NPs affects the physiology and nutrient profile of the second generation plants. However, the lack of concentration-dependent responses indicate that complex physiological processes are involved which alter uptake and metabolism of CeO2-NPs in wheat.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Rico, C., M.

",Differentiating Pathway-Specific From Nonspecific Effects in High-Throughput Toxicity Data: A Foundation for Prioritizing Adverse Outcome Pathway Development,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Previous work identified a 'cytotoxic burst' (CTB) phenomenon wherein large numbers of the ToxCast assays begin to respond at or near test chemical concentrations that elicit cytotoxicity, and a statistical approach to defining the bounds of the CTB was developed. To focus AOP development on the molecular targets corresponding to ToxCast assays indicating pathway-specific effects, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify which assays most frequently respond at concentrations below the CTB. A preliminary list of potentially important, target-specific assays was determined by ranking assays by the fraction of chemical hits below the CTB compared to the number of chemicals tested. Additional priority assays were identified using a diagnostic-odds-ratio approach which gives greater ranking to assays with high specificity but low responsivity. Combined, the two prioritization methods identified several novel targets (e.g., peripheral benzodiazepine and progesterone receptors) to prioritize for AOP development, and affirmed the importance of a number of existing AOPs aligned with ToxCast targets (e.g., thyroperoxidase, estrogen receptor, aromatase).This dataset is associated with the following publication: Fay, K., J.

Modeling Dispersion of Emissions from Depressed Roadways. Authors: Seyedmorteza Amini, Faraz Enayati Ahangar, David K. Heist, Steven G. Perry, Akula Venkatram. This paper presents an analysis of data from a wind tunnel study of dispersion of emissions from three depressed roadway configurations, a 6 m deep depressed roadway with vertical sidewalls, a 6 m deep depressed roadway with 30deg sloping sidewalls, and a 9 m deep depressed roadway with vertical sidewalls. All these configurations induce complex flow fields, increase turbulence levels, and decrease surface concentrations downwind of the depressed road compared to those of the at-grade configuration. The parameters of flat terrain dispersion models are modified to describe concentrations measured downwind of the depressed roadways. In the first part of the paper, a flat terrain model proposed by van Ulden (1978) is adapted. It turns out that this model with increased initial vertical dispersion and friction velocity is able to explain the observed concentration field. The results also suggest that the vertical concentration profiles of all cases under neutral conditions are best explained by a vertical distribution function with an exponent of 1.3. In the second part of the paper, these modifications are incorporated into a model based on the RLINE line-source dispersion model. While this model can be adapted to yield acceptable estimates of near-surface concentrations (z< 6m) measured in the wind tunnel, the Gaussian vertical distribution in RLINE, with an exponent of 2, cannot describe the concentration at higher elevations. Our findings suggest a simple method to account for depressed highways in models such as RLINE and AERMOD through two parameters that modify vertical plume spread.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Amini, S., F.

We analyzed mRNA-sequencing data from exposed one-year-old needles. Our hypothesis is that 2-week chamber exposure to DECe would induce certain distinct transcriptome changes in the needles compared with responses to conventional diesel exhaust (DE) or filtered DECe Gas Phase. Blast2GO gene ontologies (GOs) enriched by significantly up-regulated DECe transcripts were nested within the GOs for DE, however, 93.5% of enriched GOs for significantly down-regulated DECe transcripts were unique. DECe attenuated expression of genes that affect functions of transferases, kinases, transmembrane transporters, transcription factors, diester hydrolases and RNA polymerase III, processes of protein phosphorylation, responses to stimuli, hormones and chemicals, carbohydrate transport, RNA polymerase III transcription, and cellular anion homeostasis, plus, components of the plasma membrane. MapMan analysis also identified RNA regulation of transcription, protein degradation, and lipid metabolism pathways that were enriched with DECe down-regulated transcripts. Divergent DECe treatment effects were associated with significantly elevated needle uptake of cerium. DE affected expression of more genes than DECe. Nevertheless, unique transcriptome profile changes suggest that chronic DECe exposure may adversely affect plant growth and development.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Reichman, J.R., P.T.

",Coliform persistence in aircraft water systems and assessment of disinfection and flushing procedures,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"In 2009, the EPA promulgated the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR), which aims to ensure that safe and reliable drinking water is provided to aircraft passengers and crew. The rule sets a schedule for disinfection, flushing and coliform/E. coli sampling, in addition to instituting best practices and operator training. In this study, a full scale reproduction of an aircraft drinking water system was constructed at the Test and Evaluation (T&E) facility in Cincinnati, OH. The water system was conditioned using municipal tap water with a mixture of free chlorine and chloramines, and subsequently contaminated with coliforms. Disinfection was undertaken using two common airline industry methods: chlorine dioxide at 100 mg/L (or higher) for two hours, and ozone at 1 mg/L (or higher) for 5 minutes. After disinfection, the water system was flushed until no disinfectant residual remained and then filled with treated municipal drinking water.Results show that coliforms were not persistent on the aircraft plumbing surfaces, and no coliform positives were detected after disinfection and flushing. The one exception was the aerator attached to the faucet typically installed in the lavatory, was positive for coliforms after disinfection. These data suggest that the faucet aerators could be a source of coliform contamination that may result in coliform positive samples taken under the ADWR. Further experiments conducted on disinfection of aerators with glycolic acid and quaternary ammonia (both commonly used by the airlines) showed no detectable coliforms on coliform contaminated aerators after 30 minutes of soaking in the disinfectants. However, many airlines disinfect aerators by the above methods or simply replace the aerators during each disinfection, effectively eliminating this potential source of coliform contamination.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Szabo, J., M.

Research is being conducted to define the biological targets chemicals may interact with to disrupt thyroid hormone signaling and the stages in development where that disruption can most readily lead to adverse effects. The present data characterize the expression of key genes associated with thyroid hormone signaling and regulation over the course of development for two small fish widely used in aquatic ecotoxicology research. These data provide baseline information that can lead to a more complete understanding of which thyroid disrupting chemicals fish may be susceptible to and at which stages in development.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Vergauwen, L., J.

Denitrification rates in sediments from a marine-dominated intertidal sand flat near the mouth of the estuary averaged 0.181 +-0.114 mmol m-2 d-1 whereas sediments in the estuary (5 stations) and river averaged 0.626 +-0.141 mmol m-2 d-1. Sediment cores from all estuarine sites indicated denitrification activity throughout the year and were within the values reported for other temperate estuaries. Denitrification rates decreased with depth from 0.4 mmol m-2 d-1 in the upper 2 to 5 cm of sediment to 0.006 mmol m-2 d-1 at 28 cm sediment depth, indicating denitrification occurred primarily in the upper 5 cm. There was no relationship between denitrification rate and nitrate concentrations in the overlying water column (r2 = 0.16). Denitrification rates were lowest in areas with low sediment carbon content, particularly in the sandy intertidal areas at the mouth of the estuary (r2 = 0.78). The results suggest that denitrification rates in this estuary were influenced primarily by the availability of organic carbon. The amount of nitrogen removed by denitrification was estimated to be 8.7 percent of the annual Yaquina River load for August 2003 through August 2004. The relatively low percent lost via denitrification may be due to high river discharge when the nitrogen load was greatest during winter storm events and dissolved nitrogen was exported directly from the estuary into the Pacific Ocean. Stable isotopes were used to investigate the carbon source. The carbon isotope data increased from -27 d13C in the freshwater river to -21.5 d13C at the seawater site, reflecting a typical change from terrestrial plant vegetation to phytoplankton carbon sources. Similar values for d13C between suspended and benthic sediments indicated resuspension and mixing occurred during tidal inflow.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Sigleo, A.

This pathogen survives for many days in the environment and water. It is a very slow growing pathogen and can take several days to detect using the traditional microbiological culture methods. Therefore, a high-throughput RV-PCR protocol was developed and optimized by the EPA ORD's National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) to relatively rapidly detect F. tularensis. The RV-PCR method combines relatively shorter sample enrichment in growth media, and highly specific and sensitive PCR assay-based detection and identification of F. tularensis. Using this method, results can be obtained in 36 hours as compared to several days by the traditional microbiological culture methods. This manuscript contains summarized data from multiple experimental results to show the method performance in various experimental conditions mimicking a real-world interference material.

",Contribution of regional-scale fire events to ozone and PM2.5 air quality estimated by photochemical modeling approaches,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Two specific fires from 2011 are tracked for local to regional scale contribution to ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) using a freely available regulatory modeling system that includes the BlueSky wildland fire emissions tool, Spare Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model, Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model, and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) photochemical grid model. The modeling system was applied to track the contribution from a wildfire (Wallow) and prescribed fire (Flint Hills) using both source sensitivity and source apportionment approaches. The model estimated fire contribution to primary and secondary pollutants are comparable using source sensitivity (brute-force zero out) and source apportionment (Integrated Source Apportionment Method) approaches. Model estimated O3 enhancement relative to CO is similar to values reported in literature indicating the modeling system captures the range of O3 inhibition possible near fires and O3 production both near the fire and downwind. O3 and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) are formed in the fire plume and transported downwind along with highly reactive VOC species such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde that are both emitted by the fire and rapidly produced in the fire plume by VOC oxidation reactions. PAN and aldehydes contribute to continued downwind O3 production. The transport and thermal decomposition of PAN to nitrogen oxides (NOX) enables O3 production in areas limited by NOX availability and the photolysis of aldehydes to produce free radicals (HOX) causes increased O3 production in NOX rich areas. The modeling system tends to overestimate hourly surface O3 at routine rural monitors in close proximity to the fires when the model predicts elevated fire impacts on O3 and Hazard Mapping System (HMS) data indicates possible fire impact. A sensitivity simulation in which solar radiation and photolysis rates were more aggressively attenuated by aerosol in the plume reduced model O3 but does not eliminate this bias. A comparison of model predicted daily average speciated PM2.5 at surface rural routine network sites when the model predicts fire impacts from either of these fires shows a tendency toward overestimation of PM2.5 organic aerosol in close proximity to these fires. The standard version of the CMAQ treats primarily emitted organic aerosol as non-volatile. An alternative approach for treating organic aerosol as semi-volatile resulted in lower PM2.5 organic aerosol from these fires but does not eliminate the bias. Future work should focus on modeling specific fire events that are well characterized in terms of size, emissions, and have extensive measurements taken near the fire and downwind to better constrain model representation of important physical and chemical processes (e.g. aerosol photolysis attenuation and organic aerosol treatment) related to wild and prescribed fires.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Baker, K., M.

Building materials, representing nonporous and porous surfaces, were contaminated with common pesticides, including malathion, carbaryl, fipronil, deltamethrin, and permethrin as well as commercial formulations thereof. Pesticide surface concentrations were representative of the pesticide-specific levels measured during field investigations involving misapplications of pesticides in homes or businesses (25-2,400 ug/100 cm2 surface concentration range). Decontamination testing occurred via a single or repeated application of the decontaminant without further mechanical removal or rinse steps. Decontaminants were both off-the-shelf and specialized solutions representing various chemistries (hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium compounds and ammonium salts).

",Divergent trends in life expectancy across the rural-urban gradient and association with specific racial proportions in the contiguous United States 2000-2005,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"We used individual-level death data to estimate county-level life expectancy at 25 (e25) for Whites, Black, AIAN and Asian in the contiguous US for 2000-2005. Race-sex-stratified models were used to examine the associations among e25, rurality and specific race proportion, adjusted for socioeconomic variables. Individual death data from the National Center for Health Statistics were aggregated as death counts into five-year age groups by county and race-sex groups for the contiguous US for years 2000-2005 (National Center for Health Statistics 2000-2005). We used bridged-race population estimates to calculate five-year mortality rates. The bridged population data mapped 31 race categories, as specified in the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards for the collection of data on race and ethnicity, to the four race categories specified under the 1977 standards (the same as race categories in mortality registration) (Ingram et al. 2003). The urban-rural gradient was represented by the 2003 Rural Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), which distinguished metropolitan counties by population size, and nonmetropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metro area (United States Department of Agriculture 2016). We obtained county-level sociodemographic data for 2000-2005 from the US Census Bureau. These included median household income, percent of population attaining greater than high school education (high school%), and percent of county occupied rental units (rent%). We obtained county violent crime from Uniform Crime Reports and used it to calculate mean number of violent crimes per capita (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2010).

",E1 E2 metabolism v1,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Feminization of male fish and the role of endocrine-active chemicals in this phenomenon has been an area of intense study for many years. Estrone (E1), a natural steroid, is found in aquatic environments sometimes at relatively high concentrations. However, E1 has been less thoroughly studied than 17b-estradiol (E2) or 17a-ethynylestradiol due in part to a relatively lower potency in metabolically-limited estrogen receptor (ER) binding/activation assays. Recent evidence suggests that in vivo biotransformation of E1 to E2 may occur in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) residing in environments with high concentrations of E1, such as near wastewater treatment plants. The enzymes likely responsible for this biotransformation, 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17bHSDs), have been well characterized in mammals but to a lesser extent in fish species. In the current study, a novel systematic analysis of amino acid sequence data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database demonstrated that multiple 17bHSD isoforms are conserved across different fish species. Experimentally, we showed that metabolically-active hepatic cytosolic preparations from two commercially important salmonid species, rainbow trout and lake trout, biotransformed E1 to E2 to a degree sufficient to alter results of competitive ER binding assays. These results from in silico and in vitro analyses indicate E1 and biotransformation may play a significant role in the feminization of a variety of fish species in contaminated aquatic environments.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Tapper, M., R.

",QCL data turf microcosms 09Aug2017,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Four turfgrass systems in or near the Pinehurst Resort and Country Club, Sandhills region, North Carolina, USA was sampled. Twenty intact soil cores (5 cm diameter x 10 cm length) were collected from each turfgrass system in January and August 2016, respectively. For each turfgrass system, a total of 12 intact soil cores were used to measure N effluxes during three-week incubation, representing three replicates and four treatments: (1) no N input and 23 degC, (2) low N input (i.e., addition of 5.9 mg N as NH4NO3, equivalent to 30 kg N ha-1) and 23 degC, (3) high N input (i.e., addition of 11.8 mg N as NH4NO3, equivalent to 60 kg N ha-1) and 23 degC, and (4) high N input and 13 degC for winter samples (or 33 degC for summer samples). On day 0, water and NH4NO3 solution were added to the respective soil cores to bring soil moisture to 60% water filled pore space (WFPS). Here, we estimated soil bulk density and moisture content from the other eight intact soil cores and then calculated soil porosity assuming that soil particle density was 2.65 g cm-3. These soil cores were also used for soil pH measurement. Soil N2O and CO2 effluxes were measured almost daily via soil cores closed for 2 h and then 30-ml gas samples withdrawn from headspaces using gas-tight push button syringes with one-way luer stopcocks. On day 4, 11, and 18, roughly 80 ml leachate was collected from each soil core after 80 ml distilled water poured slowly to soil surface, drained up to 2 h, and then vacuum pumped out. Nitrous oxide was measured using a dual quantum cascade laser (QCL) N2O measurement system (Model CWQCL-200-D, Aerodyne, Billerica, MA, USA) (Chen et al., 2016). The efflux rate of N2O (ug m-2 h-1) was calculated as: ((Csample-Cair) x M x V) / (r x m x t), where Csample and Cair are the N2O concentrations in the headspace of intact soil core and ambient air (ppbv), respectively, V is the volume of intact soil core headspace (L), M is the molar mass of N2O (g mol-1), r is the molar volume at 1 atm (23.47 L mol-1 at 13 oC, 24.29 L mol-1 at 23 oC, and 25.11 L mol-1 at 33 oC), m is soil core surface area (m2), and t is the incubation time (h). The QCL system also provided the mixing ratio of natural abundance of 15N in the center and edge position of N2O, i.e., 15Na and 15Nb, respectively. After normalized to total N2O-N concentration, these ratios were used to calculate the natural abundance of 15Na and 15Nb of N2O. Then, 15N site preference was estimated by d15Na - d15Nb and used to help probe the biological source of N2O efflux.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Chen, H., T. Yang, Q.

",Florida cattle decay study,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Fecal contamination of recreational waters with cattle manure can pose a risk to public health due to the potential presence of various zoonotic pathogens. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) have a long history of use in the assessment. However, FIB quantification provides no information about pollution sources. Microbial source tracking (MST) genetic markers have been developed in response to a need to identify pollution sources, yet factors that influence host-identifier target decay once discharged into the environment are often poorly understood, especially for agriculture fecal waste sources. Here, we investigate the influence of water type (freshwater versus marine) and select environmental parameters (indigenous microbiota, ambient sunlight) on the decay of FIB and MST genetic markers originating from cattle manure. Experiments were conducted in situ using a submersible aquatic mesocosm containing dialysis bags filled with a mixture of cattle manure and ambient water. Culturable FIB (E. coli and enterococci) were enumerated by membrane filtration and the concentration of general fecal indicator bacteria (GenBac3, Entero1a, and EC23S857) and MST (Rum2Bac, CowM2, and CowM3) genetic markers were estimated by qPCR. Water type was the most significant factor influencing the decay of cattle manure indicator bacteria (three-way ANOVA, p: 0.006 to < 0.001), although the magnitude of the effect differed among microbial targets and over time. The presence of indigenous microbiota and exposure to sunlight were both significantly correlated (three-way ANOVA, p: 0.044 to < 0.001) with decay of enterococci and CowM2, while E. coli, EC23S857, Rum2Bac, and CowM3 (three-way ANOVA, p: 0.044 144 hours) of both cultivated FIB and genetic markers in marine and freshwater water types. Findings suggest that multiple environmental stressors are important determinants of FIB and MST marker persistence, but their magnitude can vary across different indicators. Selective exclusion of natural aquatic microbiota and/or sunlight typically resulted in extended survival, but the effect was minor and limited to select microbial targets.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Korajkic, A., B.

",Method Comparison Manuscript,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Coliphage are alternative fecal indicators that may be suitable surrogates for viral pathogens, but a majority of standard detection methods utilize insufficient sample volumes (1-100 mL) for routine detection in environmental waters. Here we compare three somatic and F+ coliphage enumeration methods based on a paired measurement from 1L samples collected from the Great Lakes region (n=74). Methods include: 1) a dead-end hollow fiber ultrafilter combined with single agar layer plaque assay (D-HFUF-SAL), 2) a modified SAL (M-SAL), and 3) a direct membrane filtration (DMF) technique. Overall, D-HFUF-SAL outperformed all other methods as it yielded the lowest frequency of non-detects [(ND), 10.8%] and the highest average coliphage concentrations (2.51 +- 1.02 log10 plaque forming unit/liter (PFU/L) and 0.79 +- 0.71 log10 PFU/L for somatic and F+, respectively). M-SAL yielded 29.7% ND and average concentrations of 2.26 +- 1.15 log10 PFU/L (somatic) and 0.59 +- 0.82 log10 PFU/L (F+). DMF performed worse compared to D-HFUF-SAL and M-SAL methods (ND of 65.6%, average somatic coliphage concentration 1.52 +- 1.32 log10 PFU/L, with no F+ detected), indicating this procedure is unsuitable for 1L surface water sample volumes.

",Evaluation of Monochloramine and Free Chlorine Penetration in a Drinking Water Storage Tank Sediment Using Microelectrodes,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Sediment accumulation in water storage tanks may protect microorganisms from disinfectant exposure, causing water quality degradation. However, microbial activity and disinfectant penetration within water storage sediment remains largely uncharacterized. This study evaluated monochloramine and free chlorine penetration into a 2-cm (20,000 um) deep drinking water storage tank sediment using microelectrodes. The sediment was successively exposed to 4-months monochloramine, 2-months free chlorine, and 2-months monochloramine. Temporal monochloramine, free chlorine, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate profiles were acquired using microelectrodes. Results showed that complete monochloramine or free chlorine penetration was not observed. Likewise, DO never fully penetrated the sediment, progressing inward with time to a maximum depth of 10,000 um and indicating microbial activity remained during the entire 8 months. Decreasing ammonium and increasing nitrate concentrations, with minimal nitrite accumulation, further demonstrated microbial activity and indicated complete sediment nitrification. There was measurable ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate during free chlorine application and nitrification activity gradually resumed upon a switch back to monochloramine. These findings suggest that periodic sediment removal from drinking water storage facilities is desirable to remove potentially protected environments for microorganisms.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Liu, H., D.

",Beta-2 adrenergic and glucocorticoid receptor agonists modulate ozone-induced pulmonary protein leakage and inflammation in healthy and adrenalectomized rats,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"We have previously shown that neuroendocrine activation leading to increased circulating stress hormones was necessary for mediating ozone-induced lung injury and inflammation since adrenalectomy rats were protected from these ozone effects. Because adrenalectomy is invasive and also eliminates circulating mineralocorticoids along with stress hormones, one cannot rule out their contribution in diminution of ozone-induced lung effects. The goal of this study was to evaluate if agonists of stress hormone receptors b2 adrenergic receptors and glucocorticoid receptors were able to restore ozone-induced lung injury, inflammation and innate immune cell trafficking in adrenalectomy rats, and exacerbate these effects in control rats with sham surgery. Here, we reconfirmed that the pulmonary and systemic effects of ozone inhalation, characterized by vascular leakage, neutrophilic inflammation, cytokine release in the lungs and peripheral vascular lymphopenia, were significantly diminished by adrenlectomy. The treatment with a combination of b2 adrenergic receptor and glucocorticoid receptor agonists (Clenbuterol and dexamethasone) was able to restore these ozone effects in AD rats, and further exacerbate ozone-induced lung protein leakage, inflammation and lymphopenia in sham surgery rats. It was also noted that clenbuterol plus dexamethasone itself caused injury and cytokine increases in the lung. Although a variety of b2 adrenergic receptor and glucocorticoid agonists have been widely used for the treatment of chronic lung diseases, b2 adrenergic receptor agonists have been shown to exacerbate lung inflammation in asthmatics and epidemiological studies have indicated exacerbation of lung inflammation in asthmatics during increased air pollution episodes. Even though high concentrations of agonists were used, our study provides a potential causal mechanistic link between activation of stress hormone receptors in mediation of air pollution health effects, and how these effects might be exacerbated in those receiving asthma therapy.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Henriquez, A., S.

In this study, we evaluated methods to demodify RNA highly fragmented and crosslinked by formalin fixation. Primary endpoints were RNA recovery, RNA-sequencing quality metrics, and target gene responses to a reference chemical (phenobarbital, PB). Frozen mouse liver samples from control and PB groups (n=6/group) were divided and preserved for 3 months as follows: frozen (FR), 70% ethanol (OH), 10% buffered formalin for 18 hours followed by ethanol (18F), and 10% buffered formalin (3F). Samples from OH, 18F, and 3F groups were processed to FFPE blocks and sectioned for RNA isolation. The latter group received no additional treatment (3F) or the following demodification protocols: short heated incubation with TAE buffer, overnight heated incubation with an organocatalyst using two different isolation kits, or overnight heated incubation without organocatalyst. TruSeq Stranded Total RNA libraries with Ribo-Zero were built and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Extended incubation with or without organocatalyst increased RNA yield >3-fold and enhanced quality compared to 3F, as indicated by higher RNA integrity number (>1.5-fold) and fragment analysis values (>3.0-fold). Post-sequencing metrics showed reduced bias in gene coverage and deletion rates for all extended incubation groups. Following PB-induced differential gene expression analysis, all demodification groups showed increased overlap with FR in genes (73-83%) and pathways (91-94%) compared to 3F overlap with FR (60% and 63%, respectively). These results demonstrate simple changes in RNA isolation methods that can enhance genomic analyses of FFPE samples.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Wehmas, L., C. Wood, R.

",Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors for US Industries and Commodities,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Many organizations quantify greenhouse emissions in their value chain. Emissions from purchased goods and services and capital goods, referred to as Scope 3 emissions in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard, represent a significant emissions source for many organizations. To assist in quantifying these emissions, we have developed a comprehensive set of supply chain emission factors covering all categories of goods and services in the US economy. These factors are intended for quantifying emissions from purchased goods and services using the spend-based method defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions. The factors were prepared using USEEIO models, which are a life cycle models of goods and services in the US economy.The supply chain emission factors are presented in units of kilogram emissions per US dollar of purchases for a category of goods and services with a defined life cycle scope. Sets of factors covering all sectors of the economy are provided for years from 2010 to 2016 with two levels of sector aggregation. The factors are provided for both industries and commodities, where commodities are equivalent to a category of good or service, and industries are producers of one or more commodities. A set of five data quality scores covering data reliability, temporal, geographical and technological correlation and completeness of data collection is provided along with each factor.The factors presented are as follows: 1. Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins: emissions associated with cradle to factory gate 2. Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors: emissions associated with factory gate to shelf, which includes emissions from transportation, wholesale and retail as well as adjustments for price markups 3. Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins: emissions associated with cradle to shelf (equal to the sum of the above two factors)End users of products will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins most appropriate for their use. Organizations purchasing intermediate products at the factory gate will likely find the Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins to be most appropriate.See the Executive Summary of the associated report for an example calculation using the factors.All factors are associated with limitations and variations in underlying data quality. We encourage the reader to carefully read the report to understand the differences across these sets, underlying assumptions in their calculation, their limitations to decide if they are appropriate for their intended use. If the reader deems the factors are appropriate, this report along with the factor data quality scores will aid in selection of factors best fit for their intended use.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Ingwersen, W., and M.

",Relative contributions of select multigeneration products to chamber SOA formed from photooxidation of a range (C10-C17) of n-alkanes under high NOx conditions,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"A series of chamber experiments was conducted to investigate the change in the relative contribution of multigeneration reaction products to total secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass across a range of parent n-alkanes (C10-C17) that has a high potential for SOA formation in urban atmospheres. Contributions of select first, second, and higher generation products to SOA was investigated using online speciation by an aerosol mass spectrometer and varied substantially across the range of investigated alkanes. As expected, the presence of first-generation species in SOA is limited primarily by volatility with small contributions at the low end of the investigated n-alkane range and increasing gradually as the number of carbons is increased. The formation of lower volatility second and higher generation nitrate-containing species, in contrast, appears to be mechanistically limited leading to lower average contributions of organic nitrates to OA as the size of the parent n-alkane is increased. The impact of increased water vapor concentrations similarly varied with the size of the parent alkane with diminished effect as both alkane carbon number and generation number increased. The largest impacts of water, however, were between dry (~3%) and slightly humid (~14%) with little change observed at higher relative humidities.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Docherty, K.S., W.

",Dataset for modeling spatial and temporal variation in natural background specific conductivity,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This file contains the data set used to develop a random forest model predict background specific conductivity for stream segments in the contiguous United States. This Excel readable file contains 56 columns of parameters evaluated during development. The data dictionary provides the definition of the abbreviations and the measurement units. Each row is a unique sample described as R** which indicates the NHD Hydrologic Unit (underscore), up to a 7-digit COMID, (underscore) sequential sample month. To develop models that make stream-specific predictions across the contiguous United States, we used StreamCat data set and process (Hill et al. 2016, https://github.com/USEPA/StreamCat). The StreamCat data set is based on a network of stream segments from NHD+ (McKay et al. 2012). These stream segments drain an average area of 3.1 km2 and thus define the spatial grain size of this data set. The data set consists of minimally disturbed sites representing the natural variation in environmental conditions that occur in the contiguous 48 United States. More than 2.4 million SC observations were obtained from STORET (USEPA 2016b), state natural resource agencies, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) system (USGS 2016), and data used in Olson and Hawkins (2012) (Table S1). Data include observations made between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2015 thus coincident with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data (https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/). Each observation was related to the nearest stream segment in the NHD+. Data were limited to one observation per stream segment per month. SC observations with ambiguous locations and repeat measurements along a stream segment in the same month were discarded. Using estimates of anthropogenic stress derived from the StreamCat database (Hill et al. 2016), segments were selected with minimal amounts of human activity (Stoddard et al. 2006) using criteria developed for each Level II Ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith 2014). Segments were considered as potentially minimally stressed where watersheds had 0 - 0.5% impervious surface, 0 - 5% urban, 0 - 10% agriculture, and population densities from 0.8 - 30 people/km2 (Table S3). Watersheds with observations with large residuals in initial models were identified and inspected for evidence of other human activities not represented in StreamCat (e.g., mining, logging, grazing, or oil/gas extraction). Observations were removed from disturbed watersheds, with a tidal influence or unusual geologic conditions such as hot springs. About 5% of SC observations in each National Rivers and Stream Assessment (NRSA) region were then randomly selected as independent validation data. The remaining observations became the large training data set for model calibration.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Olson, J., and S. Cormier.

Seedlings were exposed to 0 and 500 mg CeO2-NPs/L (Ce-0 and Ce-500, respectively) in hydroponic suspension supplied with NH4NO3, NH4+, or NO3-. N uptake and d15N discrimination (i.e. differences in d15N of plant and d15N of N source) were measured. Results showed that N content and 15N abundance decreased in wheat but increased in barley. Ce-500 only induced whole-plant d15N discrimination (-1.48%0, P <= 0.10) with a simultaneous decrease (P <= 0.05) in whole-plant d15N (-3.24%0) compared to Ce-0 (-2.74%0) in wheat in NH4+. Ce-500 decreased (P <= 0.01) root d15N of wheat in NH4NO3 and NH4+ (3.23 and -2.25%0, respectively) compared to Ce-0 (4.96 and -1.27%0, respectively), but increased (P <= 0.05) root d15N of wheat in NO3- (3.27%0) compared to Ce-0 (2.60%0). Synchrotron micro-XRF revealed the presence of CeO2-NPs in shoots of wheat and barley regardless of N source. Although the longer-term consequences of CeO2-NP exposure on N uptake and metabolism are unknown, the results clearly show the potential for ENMs to interfere with plant metabolism of critical plant nutrients such as N even when toxicity is not observed.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Rico, C.M., M.

We show, using direct, speciated measurements of a suite of RO2 and gas-phase dimers from O3-initiated oxidation of a-pinene that ~150 gaseous dimers (C16-20H24-34O4-13) are primarily formed through RO2 cross-reactions, with a typical rate constant of 0.75-2x10-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1 and a lower-limit dimer formation branching ratio of 4%. These findings imply a gaseous dimer yield that varies strongly with nitric oxide (NO) concentrations, of at least 0.2-2.5% by mole (0.5-6.6% by mass) for conditions typical of forested regions with low to moderate anthropogenic influence (i.e., <= 50 ppt NO). Given their very low volatility, the gaseous C16-20 dimers provide a potentially important organic medium for initial particle formation, and alone can explain 5-60% of a-pinene secondary organic aerosol mass yields measured at atmospherically relevant particle mass loadings. The responses of RO2, dimers, and highly-oxygenated multifunctional compounds (HOM) to reacted a-pinene concentration and NO imply that an average ~20% of primary a-pinene RO2 from OH reaction and 10% from ozonolysis autoxidize at 3-10 s-1 and >= 1 s-1, respectively, confirming both oxidation pathways produce HOM efficiently, even at higher NO concentrations typical of urban areas. Thus, gas-phase dimer formation and RO2 autoxdiation are ubiquitous sources of low-volatility organic compounds capable of contributing significantly to atmospheric new particle formation and growth.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Zhao, Y., J.

",E320 Diet Ozone Oxidative Stress Data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Oxidative stress (OS) is a contributing factor to the neuro, cardiac, and pulmonary effects caused by adverse metabolic states, such as obesity and type II diabetes, as well as inhalation of air borne toxicants, such as ozone (O3). The objective of this study is to understand diet/O3 interactions on OS parameters in young male Brown Norway rats maintained on regular (Purina 5001), high fructose (FRUC, TD.89247), or high fat (FAT, TD.06414) diet for 16 wks followed by exposure to either filtered air or 0.8 ppm O3 under an acute (1 d for 5 h) or subacute (5 h/d, 1 d/wk for four wks) paradigm. After 18 h of the last exposure, measures of ROS production (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and NADH-Ubiquinone reductase (UBIQ-RD) levels), antioxidant homeostasis (total antioxidant substance (TAS) and g-Glutamylcysteine synthetase (gGCS) activity), and oxidative damage (total aconitase activity and protein carbonyl (PC) content) were assayed in selected brain regions. Diet/O3 interaction did not have a global effect in the brain, but did show limited regional and OS parameter specific effects. HIP showed a significant interaction between FRUC diet/O3. Aconitase in CER showed a significant interaction between diet and O3. However, regional effects of either O3 or diet alone were more profound. Within the acute condition, there was a decrease in NQ01 and UBIQ-RD in STR and HIP, respectively, regardless of exposure. Also, CER and STR showed a change in TAS due to diet alone, while FC seemed to have a larger amount of TAS due to O3 alone. Diet appeared to affect gGCS negatively in all diet groups of HIP, and only in the FAT diet of STR. The CER also appear to have a decrease in PC in FRUC group and a general decrease in PC in all diets due to O3, while aconitase increased only in FRUC air exposed animals and control O3 exposed animals. Under the subacute condition, there was an increase of NQO1 activity in only the CER due to diets alone, while UBIQ-RD increased in only the FRUC group in FC and in both diet groups in HIP. TAS was decreased in FC only in the FAT group and a clear O3 effect where FAT increased the TAS and FRUC decreased in TAS. A significant interaction between diet/O3 was found in FC. The STR also showed a decrease in TAS in response to O3. Diet also increased PC formation within CER only in the FAT group, while HIP showed a decrease in PC after O3 exposure in controls. Aconitase in CER was affected both by diet in the filtered air group while O3 caused a decrease in controls and FRUC groups. O3 affected all groups within HIP and HYP. STR was most affected by FAT diet in both air and O3 groups. Diet seemed to be the driving factor in most OS measures. Overall, OS parameters measured do not suggest a consistent O3/diet interaction on oxidative damage pathways, but do give insight as to how high caloric diets could affect neuronal OS.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Valdez, J., A. Johnstone, J. Richards, J. Schmid, J. Royland, and P. Kodavanti. Interaction of Diet and Ozone Exposure on Oxidative Stress Parameters within Specific Brain Regions of Male Brown Norway Rats.

",EPA June 2012 12km Continental US (CONUS) Bidirectional CMAQ v5.0.2 Simulations,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This work is the first of a two-part study that aims to develop a computationally efficient bias correction framework to improve surface PM2.5 forecasts in the United States. Here, an ensemble-based Kalman filter (KF) technique is developed primarily for nonrural areas with approximately 500 surface observation sites for PM2.5 and applied to three (GEOS-Chem, WRF-Chem, and WRF-CMAQ) chemical transport model (CTM) hindcast outputs for June 2012. While all CTMs underestimate daily surface PM2.5 mass concentration by 20-50%, KF correction is effective for improving each CTM forecast. Subsequently, two ensemble methods are formulated: (1) the arithmetic mean ensemble (AME) that equally weights each model and (2) the optimized ensemble (OPE) that calculates the individual model weights by minimizing the least-square errors. While the OPE shows superior performance than the AME, the combination of either the AME or the OPE with a KF performs better than the OPE alone, indicating the effectiveness of the KF technique. Overall, the combination of a KF with the OPE shows the best results. Lastly, the Successive Correction Method (SCM) was applied to spread the bias correction from model grids with surface PM2.5 observations to the grids lacking ground observations by using a radius of influence of 125 km derived from surface observations, which further improves the forecast of surface PM2.5 at the national scale. Our findings provide the foundation for the second part of this study that uses satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products to further improve the forecast of surface PM2.5 in rural areas by performing statistical analysis of model output.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Spero, T., B.

",Contribution of Particulate Nitrate Photolysis to Heterogeneous Sulfate Formation for Winter Haze in China,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Nitrate and sulfate are two key components of airborne particulate matter (PM). While multiple formation mechanisms have been proposed for sulfate, current air quality models commonly underestimate its concentrations and mass fractions during northern China winter haze events. On the other hand, current models usually overestimate the mass fractions of nitrate. Very recently, laboratory studies have proposed that nitrous acid (N(III)) produced by particulate nitrate photolysis can oxidize sulfur dioxide to produce sulfate. Here, for the first time, we parameterize this heterogeneous mechanism into the state-of-the-art Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and quantify its contributions to sulfate formation. We find that the significance of this mechanism mainly depends on the enhancement effects (by 1-3 orders of magnitude as suggested by the available experimental studies) of nitrate photolysis rate constant (""J"" ([[""NO"" ]] ""3"" ^- )) in aerosol liquid water compared to that in the gas phase. Comparisons between model simulations and in-situ observations in Beijing suggest that this pathway can explain about 15% (assuming an enhancement factor (EF) of 10) to 65% (assuming EF = 100) of the model-observation gaps in sulfate concentrations during winter haze. Our study strongly calls for future research on reducing the uncertainty in EF.

RNA-seq offers a novel way to address this problem. In this study we evaluated transcriptomic dose responses using RNA-seq in paired FFPE and frozen (FROZ) samples from two archival studies in mice, one recent (20 years old). Experimental treatments included di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and dichloroacetic acid (DCA) for the 20 year-old studies, respectively. Total RNA was ribodepleted and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. In the recent study, FFPE samples showed high concordance in total reads (98% vs FROZ), fold-change values of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (R2 = 0.99), highly enriched target pathways (90% overlap with FROZ), and benchmark dose estimates for preselected target genes (-2% overall vs FROZ). In contrast, RNA-seq data from older FFPE samples had lower total reads (70% vs FROZ) and poor concordance in global DEGs and pathways. Despite a 99% loss of counts, dose responses were still evident for target genes in FFPE samples and positively correlated with paired FROZ samples. These findings highlight potential variability in the quality of RNA-seq data from FFPE samples. More recent FFPE samples were highly similar to FROZ samples in sequencing quality metrics, DEG profiles, and dose-response parameters, while further methods development is needed for older or lower-quality FFPE samples. This work should help broaden the use of archival resources in both chemical safety and translational science.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Hester, S., V. Bhat, B.

Our objective was to define depth-adjusted cutoff values for benthos condition classes (poor, fair, reference) to provide tool useful for assessing progress toward achieving removal targets for the degraded benthos beneficial use impairment in the AOC. The relationship between depth and benthos metrics was wedge-shaped. We therefore used quantile regression to model the limiting effect of depth on selected benthos metrics, including taxa richness, percent non-oligochaete individuals, combined percent Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata individuals, and density of ephemerid mayfly nymphs (Hexagenia). We created a scaled trimetric index from the first three metrics. Metric values at or above the 90th percentile quantile regression model prediction were defined as reference condition for that depth. We set the cutoff between poor and fair condition as the 50th percentile model prediction. We examined sampler type, exposure, geographic zone of the AOC, and substrate type for confounding effects. Based on these analyses we combined data across sampler type and exposure classes and created separate models for each geographic zone. We used the resulting condition class cutoff values to assess the relative benthic condition for three habitat restoration project areas. The depth-limited pattern of ephemerid abundance we observed in the St. Louis River AOC also occurred elsewhere in the Great Lakes. We provide tabulated model predictions for application of our depth-adjusted condition class cutoff values to new sample data.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Angradi, T., W.

",Experimental and model estimates of the contributions from biogenic monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes to secondary organic aerosol in the southeastern United States,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Atmospheric organic aerosol (OA) has important impacts on climate and human health but its sources remain poorly understood. Biogenic monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are important precursors of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), but the amounts and pathways of SOA generation from these precursors are not well constrained by observations. We propose that the less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) factor resolved from positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis on aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS) data can be used as a surrogate for fresh SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the southeastern US. This hypothesis is supported by multiple lines of evidence, including lab-in-the-field perturbation experiments, extensive ambient ground-level measurements, and state-of-the-art modeling. We performed lab-in-the-field experiments in which the ambient air is perturbed by the injection of selected monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and the subsequent SOA formation is investigated. PMF analysis on the perturbation experiments provides an objective link between LO-OOA and fresh SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes as well as insights into the sources of other OA factors. Further, we use an upgraded atmospheric model and show that modeled SOA concentrations from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes could reproduce both the magnitude and diurnal variation of LO-OOA at multiple sites in the southeastern US, building confidence in our hypothesis. We estimate the annual average concentration of SOA from monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the southeastern US to be roughly 2ugm-3.Dataset (csv file) contains CMAQ model predictions for locations in the southeastern US during 2012 and 2013.

Understanding the ability of these chemicals to mimic the effects of the steroid estrogen is of interest to the US Environmental Protection Agency and other international environmental organizations. The current study sequentially combined complementary in vitro (outside a living organism) rainbow trout estrogen receptor (rtER) binding and liver slice vitellogenin (Vtg) mRNA induction assays in the context of a defined ER-mediated adverse outcome pathway (AOP). Cyclic phenones, branched phenones, and hydroxybenzophenones bound to rtER with relative potency ranging from no affinity to high binding affinity of 0.11%, and many induced Vtg, an egg yolk protein, gene expression in rt liver slices. In addition, cyclohexylphenylketone which did not bind rtER binding in cytosol was biotransformed within liver tissue to a chemical that induced Vtg expression. Cyclic phenones, branched phenones and hydroxybenzophenones produced estrogen like responses in these rainbow trout in vitro assays.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Tapper, M., J.

",A hybrid gene selection approach to create the S1500+ targeted gene sets for use in high-throughput transcriptomics,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The U.S. Tox21 Federal collaboration, which currently quantifies the biological effects of nearly 10,000 chemicals via quantitative high-throughput screening(qHTS) in in vitro model systems, is now making an effort to incorporate gene expression profiling into the existing battery of assays. Whole transcriptome analyses performed on large numbers of samples using microarrays or RNA-Seq is currently cost-prohibitive. Accordingly, the Tox21 Program is pursuing a high-throughput transcriptomics (HTT) method that focuses on the targeted detection of gene expression for a carefully selected subset of the transcriptome that potentially can reduce the cost by a factor of 10-fold, allowing for the analysis of larger numbers of samples. To identify the optimal transcriptome subset, genes were sought that are (1) representative of the highly diverse biological space, (2) capable of serving as a proxy for expression changes in unmeasured genes, and (3) sufficient to provide coverage of well described biological pathways. A hybrid method for gene selection is presented herein that combines data-driven and knowledge-driven concepts into one cohesive method.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Mav, D., R.R.

The SECC method provides a high-throughput experimental way to tackle the challenge of prioritizing PFASs according to key proteins, especially when their authentic standards are not available. While this study is focused on hL-FABP due to its critical role in regulating the toxicokinetics of PFASs, the protein-centric method could also be adapted to screen PFASs binding to other key proteins, such as PPARs. Computational toxicology is the predominant strategy for high-throughput predictions of toxicities of chemical contaminants.

",Joint measurements of black carbon and particle mass for heavydutydiesel vehicles using a portable emission measurement system,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"PEMS-chasing experiments were conducted for twelve heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDTs) to evaluate the accuracy of mobile measurement results. Two data processing approaches were integrated to automate the calculations of fuel consumption-based emission factors of nitrogen oxides (NOX). With a total of 245 plume chasing tests conducted, and then averaged by vehicle and road types, we found that the relative errors of vehicle-specific emission factors using an algorithm developed for this project were within approximately +- 20% of the PEMS results for all tested vehicles. Stochastic simulations suggested reasonable results could be obtained using fewer chasing tests per vehicle (e.g., 71% for freeways and 93% for local road, equivalent to two chase tests per vehicle). This study improves the understanding of the accuracy of the mobile chasing method, and provides a practical approach for real-time emission measurements for future scaled-up mobile chasing studies.This dataset is associated with the following publications: Wu, Y., H.

The first simulation was performed for July 1 - 31 over a 12 km modeling domain covering the Western U.S. The simulation was configured with the Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM) to estimate the contributions from 9 source categories to modeled ozone. ISAM source contributions for July 17 - 31 averaged over all grid cells located in Colorado were used to generate the illustrative pie chart in the overview article. The second simulation was performed for October 1, 2013 - August 31, 2014 over a 108 km modeling domain covering the northern hemisphere. This simulation was also configured with ISAM to estimate the contributions from non-US anthropogenic sources, natural sources, stratospheric ozone, and other sources on ozone concentrations. Ozone ISAM results from this simulation were extracted along a boundary curtain of the 12 km modeling domain specified over the Western U.S. for the time period January 1, 2014 - July 31, 2014 and used to generate the illustrative time-height cross-sections in the overview article.The EPA/OAR/OAQPS-generated dataset consisted of hourly gridded CMAQ output for surface ozone concentrations for the year 2016.

",Saunders et al_IVIVE paper_Science Hub_entry_08142020,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The purpose of is this study was to evaluate the potential for biotransformation in the gastrointestinal tissues (GIT) of fish to impact chemical bioaccumulation. In vitro biotransformation of two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pyrene (PYR) and benzo[a]pyrene (BAP), and two organic sunscreen agents, 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) and octocrylene (OCT), was measured using S9 fractions isolated from liver tissue and tissues of the upper GIT in rainbow trout. For PYR, BAP, and EHMC, activity was substantially higher in liver S9 fractions than in GIT S9 fractions. For OCT, activity was highest in GIT S9 fractions. An existing in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) model for fish, which yields a whole-animal biotransformation rate constant (kMET), was expanded to consider biotransformation in the GIT. The kMET values obtained using measured rates of in vitro activity (liver and GIT) were in good agreement with kMET values measured in controlled in vivo experiments, providing strong support for the IVIVE approach. Moreover, inclusion of GIT activity into the model prediction for OCT resulted in much better agreement with the empirical kMET estimate than was obtained using a 'liver only' model. These findings suggest that current 'liver only' approaches to IVIVE modeling may underestimate in vivo whole-animal biotransformation rates for chemicals that undergo substantial biotransformation in the GIT. Thus, failure to consider biotransformation in the GIT may lead to overestimation of true levels of bioaccumulation.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Saunders, L., P.

The objective of this study was to investigate the use of pyrolysis as a possible technique to recover valuable materials and energy from different components of e-waste as an alternative approach for limiting their disposal to landfills. The study includes investigating the potential impact of thermal processing of e-waste.Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) of e-waste components were used to better understand the mass loss characteristics of the pyrolysis process up to 700 oC. The changes in e-waste chemical components during pyrolysis were considered using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) techniques. The energy recovery from pyrolysis was made in a horizontal tube furnace under anoxic and isothermal condition of selected temperatures of 300, 400 and 500 oC. Critical and valuable metals were recovered from electronic components. Pyrolysis produced liquid and gas mixtures organic compounds that can be used as fuels, but the process also emitted particulate matter and semi-volatile organic products, and the remaining ash contained leachable pollutants. Furthermore, toxicity leaching characteristic profile of e-waste and partly oxidized products were conducted to measure the levels of pollutants leached before and after pyrolysis at selected temperatures. The results of this study contribute to the development of alternative approaches to practical recycling that could especially help reduce plastic pollution and recover materials of value from e-waste. Additionally, this information may be used to assess the risk of exposure of workers to emissions semi-formal recycling centers.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Sahle-Demessie, E., B.

However, the life cycle emissions associated with various fuels can differ considerably, potentially impacting the effectiveness of fuel switching. Life cycle emissions, which include emissions from extracting, processing, transporting, and distributing fuels, as well as manufacturing and constructing new generating capacity, have received less consideration in policy-making. Life cycle analysis allows quantification of these emissions such that they can be considered in decision-making. We examine a hypothetical electric sector emission reduction target for nitrogen oxides using the Global Change Assessment Model with U.S. state-level resolution. When only power plant emissions are considered in setting an emission reduction target, fuel switching leads to an increase in upstream emissions that offsets a portion of the targeted reductions. When fuel extraction, processing, and transport emissions are included under the reduction target, the resulting control strategy meets the required reductions and does so at lower cost. However, manufacturing and construction emissions increase, indicating that it may be beneficial to consider these sources as well. In the real world, life cycle-based approaches could be implemented by allowing industry to earn reduction credits by reducing upstream emissions. We discuss some of the limitations of such an approach, including the difficulty in identifying the location of upstream emissions, which may occur across regulatory authorities or even outside of the U.S.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Babaee, S., D.

Primary human thyroid cells procured from qualified euthyroid donors were analyzed for retention of NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1), Keratin 7 (KRT7), and Thyroglobulin (TG) expression by high-content image analysis to verify enrichment of follicular epithelial cells. A direct comparison of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) 96-well culture formats was employed to characterize the morphology, differential gene expression, TG production, and TH synthesis over the course of 20 days.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Deisenroth, C., V.

Differentiating iPSC-derived endoderm was exposed to five concentrations of ATRA between 0.001 and 10 uM at 6h, 96h, or 192h and assessed for forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) protein expression and global gene transcript expression measured by RNA-sequencing. A tipping point of 17+-11 nM was identified where patterns of differentially expressed genes supported a shift in the developmental trajectory away from embryonic endoderm in favor of mesoderm and extraembryonic endoderm. Five concentrations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) between 0.001 and 10 uM were compared to time-matched 0.1% DMSO controls at three timepoints (6h, 96h, and 192h) in differentiating endoderm.

",TREE BOX PERFORMANCE IN EXFILTRATING STORMWATER RUNOFF,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This study determines the exfiltration rates in six tree boxes and analyzes their performance over time. The study site is in Louisville, KY, where we monitored the performance of six tree boxes and other stormwater control measures (SCMs). Each tree box is 1.5 m wide, 1.5 m long, and 1.8 m deep. Street and parking lot runoff enters tree boxes though a curb cut. A 46-cm diameter shaft was drilled at the bottom of each tree box to reach the underlying permeable soil layer. A pressure transducer installed at the bottom of the shaft measured the water level depth and water temperature. From the water level data, the exfiltration rate of six tree boxes was calculated for 121 rain events. For each rain event the exfiltration rate was calculated at different water levels inside the shaft. The effects of water level inside the shaft, temperature, and age on the exfiltration rate were analyzed. Exfiltration rate increased with water level and exfiltration rate in first year is significantly larger than second year. Overall in second year the decrease in geometric mean exfiltration rate was largest for moderate depth. The exfiltration rate of the tree boxes is significantly larger for warmer rain events and significantly smaller for cooler rain events. This paper highlights the use of continuous two years' water level monitoring data to quantify the potential for local recharge via exfiltration, and the effect of different parameter on the exfiltration rate of six tree boxes.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Ahmed, F., and M.

",Fates of Nanoparticles in Simulated Gastric Fluid Studied using Single-Particle-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This study adds to the growing knowledge of the fates of ENPs under conditions that simulate the human stomach. The fates of different nanoparticles after exposure to a simulated human digestion system is highly relevant to understand the impact of ENPs overall as they become more integrated into daily life, potentially resulting in increased exposures. Various factors such as species, size, the concentration of ingested ENPs, and body temperature on the fates of nanoparticles in the human digestion system proved to be varied and complex. This research highlights the need for a better understanding of nanomaterials' properties in the digestive system under other physiologically relevant conditions. This work contributes to an improved understanding of the fates of ENPs in gastric fluid, which gives insights into the gastrointestinal uptake of these ENPs before they enter into the blood circulation and organ systems. It is especially crucial for nanoparticles not completely solubilized in the digestive system's physiological contact time because these ENPs will enter into the other body systems and potentially circulate through the body as particulates. Using this study framework, sequentially studying in other tissues, especially for those ENPs not dissolved in SGF, including Ag-NPs, Au-NPs, and CeO!2-NPs, would be valuable to evaluate the potential risk of ENPs to human health.

","Monoassociation with bacterial isolates reveals the role of colonization, community complexity and abundance on locomotor behavior in larval zebrafish",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Across taxa, animals with depleted intestinal microbiomes show disrupted behavioral phenotypes. Axenic (i.e., microbe-free) mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies exhibit increased locomotor behavior, or hyperactivity. The mechanism through which bacteria interact with host cells to trigger normal neurobehavioral development in larval zebrafish is unknown. Here, we monoassociated zebrafish with either one of six different zebrafish-associated bacteria, mixtures of these host-associates, or with an environmental bacterial isolate. We found that while the axenic cohort was hyperactive, monoassociation with three different host-associated bacterial species, as well as with the mixtures, resulted in control-like locomotor behavior. Monoassociation with one host-associate and the environmental isolate resulted in the hyperactive phenotype characteristic of axenic larvae, while monoassociation with two other host-associated bacteria partially blocked this phenotype. Furthermore, we found an intriguing inverse relationship between the total concentration of bacteria per larvae and locomotor behavior. These data support a growing body of evidence that individual species of bacteria can have different effects on host behavior, potentially related to their success at intestinal colonization. Specific to the zebrafish model, our results suggest that differences in the composition of microbes in fish facilities could have profound effects on the outcomes of behavioral and pharmacological studies.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Weitekamp, C., A.

",A cross-platform approach to characterize and screen potential neurovascular unit toxicants,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Development of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is a complex, multistage process that requires orchestrated cell signaling mechanisms across several cell types and ultimately results in the formation of the blood-brain barrier. Typical high-throughput screening (HTS) assays investigate single biochemical or single cell responses following chemical insult. As the NVU comprises multiple cell types interacting at various stages of development, a methodology for combining high-throughput results across pertinent cell-based assays is needed to investigate potential chemical-induced disruption to the development of this complex cell system. To this end, we developed a novel method for screening putative NVU disruptors across diverse assay platforms to predict chemical perturbation of the developing NVU. Here, HTS assay results measuring chemical-induced perturbations to cellular key events across angiogenic and neurogenic outcomes were combined to create a cell-based prioritization of NVU hazard. Using activity from each biological outcome, chemicals were grouped into similar modes of action and used to train a logistic regression literature model. This model utilizes the chemical-specific pairwise mutual information score for PubMed MeSH annotations to represent how often a chemical was shown to produce a specific outcome in the published literature space. Taken together, this study presents a methodology to investigate NVU developmental hazard using cell-based HTS assays and literature evidence to prioritize screening of putative NVU disruptors. The results from these screening efforts demonstrate how chemicals that represent a range of putative vascular disrupting compound (pVDC) scores based on angiogenic endpoints can also produce effects on neurogenic outcomes such as neurite outgrowth, neuroprogenitor/neural crest migration, representing an additional method for understanding the range of possible modes of action for disruption of the developing NVU.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Zurlinden, T., K.

A comprehensive study is lacking that assesses the effect of GAC characteristics on adsorption oxidation treatment of contaminant-spent GAC. Consequently, it is inherently assumed the treatment process is GAC-independent. Here, GACs (n=31) were characterized and used in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based adsorption oxidation treatment of 2-chlorophenol (2CP)-spent GAC. The GACs exhibited a range in surface area, pore volume distribution, metals content, surface functionality, and H2O2 reaction. Chloride recovery, the treatment metric for 2CP oxidation, indicated a wide range in oxidation (0-49.2%) where bituminous- and wood-based GAC performed best. A selected subset of GACs (n=12), amended with iron, methyl tert-butyl ether, and H2O2, exhibited a range in oxidative treatment (1.1-57.9%). Correlations were established between GAC surface functionality, H2O2 reactivity, adsorption, and contaminant oxidation indicating multiple parameters play a collective and compounding role. The order of GACs successfully used in the treatment process is bituminous-based coal > wood > coconut > peat. Results showed adsorption oxidation treatment is GAC-dependent, and therefore, GAC selection is a key factor in the success of this technology.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Rusevova Crincoli, K., P.K.

",Contrasting radical activity,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Reaction intermediates formed during the ultra-violet (UV) activation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (UV-AHP) and persulfate (S2O82-) (UV-APS) include hydroxyl (*OH) and sulfate radicals (SO4*-), respectively. These radicals, used in oxidation treatment systems to degrade a broad spectrum of environmental contaminants, may also react with non-target chemical species (scavengers) that limit treatment efficiency. UV-AHP and UV-APS treatment systems were amended with solid phase alumina to assess scavenging by solid surfaces. The relative rates of reaction between the target compound, rhodamine B dye (RhB), and aqueous and solid phase scavengers was used to assess treatment performance. The overall rate of reaction and rate of radical scavenging was greater for *OH than SO4*-. Scavenging by dissolved constituents was dominated by the oxidant used (H2O2, S2O82-), and the rate of radical scavenging by alumina was greater than the rate of RhB oxidation in all cases. Treatment efficiency was lower in the UV-AHP than in the UV-APS treatment system and was attributed to greater aqueous and solid phase scavenging rates. The cost of commercially available H2O2 ($0.031 mol-1) and PS ($0.24 mol-1) was used in conjunction with the overall treatment efficiency to assess specific cost of treatment. The specific cost to treat the probe compound with UV-AHP was greater than UV-APS and was attributed to the much lower treatment efficiency with UV-AHP. The much-desired high reaction rate constants between *OH and environmental contaminants, relative to SO4*-, comes at the cost of greater combined scavenging rates, and consequently lower treatment efficiency.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Rusevova Crincoli, K., and S.G.

",How to Support the Application of Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis? Let us Start with a Taxonomy,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Decision making is a complex task that involves a multitude of perspectives, constraints, and variables. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a process that has been used for several decades to support decision making. It includes a series of steps that systematically help Decision Maker(s) (DM(s)) and stakeholders in structuring a decision problem, identifying their preferences and building a decision recommendation consistent with those preferences. Over the last decades, many studies have demonstrated the conduct of the MCDA process and how to select an MCDA method. Until now, there has not been a review of these studies, nor a proposal of a unified and comprehensive high-level representation of the MCDA process characteristics (i.e., features), which is the goal of this paper. We introduce a review of the research that defines how to conduct the MCDA process, compares MCDA methods and presents Decision Support Systems (DSSs) to recommend a relevant MCDA method or a subset of methods. We then synthesize this research into a taxonomy of 10 characteristics of the MCDA process, grouped into three main phases, (i) problem formulation, (ii) construction of the decision recommendation and (iii) qualitative features and technical support. Each of these phases includes a subset of the 10 characteristics that help the analyst implementing the MCDA process, while also being aware of the implication of these choices at each step. By showing how decision making can be split into manageable and justifiable steps, we reduce the risk of overwhelming the analyst, as well as the DMs/stakeholders during the MCDA process. Additionally, we show how the DSSs for MCDA method recommendation can be grouped into three main clusters, such that a traceable and categorizable development of such systems can be enhanced.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Cinelli, M., M.

",Associations between cumulative environmental quality and ten selected birth defects in Texas,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) of the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) is an active surveillance system that maintains information on infants with structural and chromosomal birth defects born to mothers residing in Texas at the time of birth (Texas Department of State Health Services, 2019). TBDR staff review medical records to identify and abstract relevant case information, which then undergoes extensive quality checks (Texas Department of State Health Services, 2019). All diagnoses are made prenatally or within one year after delivery (Texas Department of State Health Services, 2019). Data on cases was obtained from the TBDR. Information on live births for the denominators and on covariates for cases and denominators was obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Services Center for Health Statistics. This research was approved by the Texas Department of State Health Services Institutional Review Board and US EPA Human Subjects Review.The Environmental Quality Index (EQI) estimates overall county-level environmental quality for the entire US for 2006-2010. The construction of the EQI is described elsewhere (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2020). Briefly, the national data was compiled to represent simultaneous, cumulative environmental quality across each of the five domains: air (43 variables) representing criteria and hazardous air pollutants, water (51 variables), representing overall water quality, general water contamination, recreational water quality, drinking water quality, atmospheric deposition, drought, and chemical contamination, land (18 variables), representing agriculture, pesticides, contaminants, facilities, and radon, built (15 variables), representing roads, highway/road safety, public transit behavior, business environment, and subsidized housing environment, and sociodemographic (12 variables), representing socioeconomics and crime. The variables in each domain specific index were reduced using principal component analysis (PCA), with the first component retained as that domain's index value. The domain specific indices were valence corrected to ensure that the directionality of the variables was consistent with higher values suggesting poorer environmental quality. The domain specific indices were then processed through a second PCA and the first index retained as the overall EQI. The overall and domain specific EQI indices are publicly available through the US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency: https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/NHEERL/EQI).

",Assessing reproductive effects of aromatase inhibition on fishes with group-synchronous oocyte development using western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as a model,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Predictive models and frameworks for linking inhibition of the enzyme aromatase, as measured in non-animal high throughput screening assays, to adverse effects on reproduction in fish have been established. However, those models were established using data from several fish species commonly reared in the laboratory that employ a particular reproductive strategy involving asynchronous oocyte development and repeat spawning. Many fish species employ synchronous oocyte development and spawn annually. This product was intended to help address the question of whether the current approaches for predicting impacts of aromatase inhibitors are applicable to fish with a synchronous/annual spawning reproduction strategy. The study establishes the mosquitofish as a viable laboratory model with synchronous oocyte development and provides preliminary evidence that exposure to aromatase inhibitors during a critical period of the reproductive cycle can lead to adverse effects on fish reproduction.This dataset provides all the data used to generate the tables and figures presented in Doering et al.

",SMPSS GI Assessment,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Green infrastructure (GI) is widely recognized for reducing risk of flooding, improving water quality, and harvesting stormwater for potential future use. GI can be an important part of a strategy used in urban planning to enhance sustainable development and urban resilience. However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive assessment framework to evaluate GI performance in terms of promoting ecosystem functions and services for social-ecological system resilience. We propose a scenario-based planning support system to assess the capacity of urban resilience by using a robust indicator set consisting of quantitative and qualitative measurements. Green Infrastructure in Urban Resilience Planning Support System (GIUR-PSS) supports decision-making for GI planning through scenario comparisons with the urban resilience capacity index. To demonstrate GIUR-PSS, we developed five scenarios for the Congress Run sub-watershed (Mill Creek watershed, Ohio, USA) to test common types of GI (rain barrels, rain gardens, detention basins, porous pavement, and open space). Results show the open space scenario achieves the overall highest performance (GI Urban Resilience Index = 4.27/5). To implement the open space scenario in our urban demonstration site, suitable vacant lots could be converted to greenspace (e.g., forest, detention basins, and low-impact recreation areas). GIUR-PSS is easy to replicate, customize, and apply to cities of different sizes to assess environmental, economic, and social benefits provided by different types of GI installations.Additional data described in the manuscript are available through identified data sources indicated therein.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Fu, X., M.

",Predicted Background Conductivity Data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This ""Predicted Background Conductivity"" view consists of a shapefile derived from National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2.0 which displays modeled natural background conductivity for the continental United States. The displayed information is based on specific conductivity predictions for stream segments in the contiguous United States from the Natural Background Specific Conductivity (NBSC) model. The NBSC model was developed using a random forest modeling approach and enables comparison with measured in-stream conductivity. Geology, soil, vegetation, climate and other empirically measured data were used as inputs. The NBSC model was designed for streams with natural background SC < 2000 uS/cm. Above this level (typical for freshwater), NBSC model estimates may be less reliable. Data for some parameters that affect background SC were not readily available and were therefore not included in the model. These include freshwater and marine interfaces, natural mineral springs, salt deposits which may affect groundwater and streams, and other natural sources of salts. In such areas, the model is likely to underestimate SC. Local knowledge is often necessary to assess differences between predicted and measured background SC. More information about the model and datasets can be found at Freshwater Explorer Story Metadata. The calculated predicted background conductivity for individual stream segments in the contiguous U.S.A. and metadata are accessible from the ArcGIS platform on Predicted Background Conductivity Data.

",Case study in 21st century ecotoxicology: using in vitro aromatase inhibition data to predict short term in vivo responses in adult female fish,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This research was designed to evaluate whether a biologically-based computational model aligned with an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) could effectively predict animal (in vivo) responses to chemicals shown to inhibit the enzyme aromatase in a non-animal (in vitro) screening assays. Aromatase is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of estrogens, an important class of hormones, and chemicals that inhibit aromatase are viewed as probable endocrine disrupting compounds. Although the model was not able to accurately predict the average in vivo responses observed for all chemicals tested, there was strong qualitative to semi-quantitative agreement with the proposed AOP and predictions did fall within the distribution of measured values. Consequently, this ""new approach methodology"" likely has utility for screening-level assessments. This work helps to establish the confidence and limitations of this approach. The data set includes: 1) High throughput screening results for chemicals identified as aromatase inhibitors. 2) Novel in vitro aromatase inhibition data for six chemicals. 3) Modeled predictions of impacts on 17b-estradiol and vitellogenin concentrations over a range of concentrations. 4) Measured biological effects of 3 aromatase inhibitors in fathead minnows exposed for 24 h. 5) Measured plasma and water concentrations of the test chemicals.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Villeneuve, D., B.

","The Effects of Combinations of Limited Ration and Diazinon Exposure on Acetylcholinesterase Activity, Growth, and Reproduction in Oryzias latipes, the Japanese medaka",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Environmental contamination can negatively impact fish populations. In addition to acute toxicity leading to death, toxicants can reduce fish growth and lower reproduction. The potential for adverse population level effects of environmental contaminants are estimated from laboratory toxicity tests that most often measure apical endpoints related to growth, survival, and reproduction. The relationships between these endpoints are being evaluated to better predict shifts in fish population demography after exposure to environmental toxicants. Environmental contaminants can also affect fish populations indirectly by reducing prey biomass. However, estimating the combined effects of prey reduction and direct toxicity is difficult and rarely attempted. Here we describe a toxicity test designed to estimate the effect on Japanese medaka of both reduced food and chronic exposure to diazinon, an acetylcholinesterase inhibiting organophosphate pesticide. Fish were reared with limited food ration and/or diazinon exposure through a full life-cycle to assess possible interactions between the two stressors in their effects on growth and reproduction. Diazinon exposure, reduced ration, or combinations of both lowered growth rates and reproductive output of Japanese medaka. Various relationships between the two stressors (diazinon and ration) and growth and reproduction were modeled. These results inform fish models being developed by EPA to predict population consequences of chemical exposures.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Flynn, K., J. Swintek, F. Whiteman, and M. Etterson. The effects of combinations of limited ration and diazinon exposure on acetylcholinesterase activity, growth, and reproduction in Oryzias latipes, the Japanese medaka.

",Effects of shading and composition on green roof media temperature and moisture data set,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Three of the primary functions of green roofs in urban areas are to delay rainwater runoff, moderate building temperatures, and ameliorate the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A major impediment to the survival of plants on an unirrigated extensive green roof (EGR) is the harsh rooftop environment, including high temperatures and limited water during dry periods. Factors that influence EGR thermal and hydrologic performance include the albedo (reflectivity) of the roof and the composition of the green roof substrate (growing media). In this study we used white, reflective shading structures and three different media formulations to evaluate EGR thermal and hydrologic performance in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Shading significantly reduced daytime mean and maximum EGR media temperatures and significantly increased nighttime mean and minimum temperatures, which may provide energy benefits to buildings. Mean media moisture was greater in shaded trays than in exposed (unshaded) trays but differences were not statistically significant.

Scientific software developers often find it challenging to carry out systematic and automated testing due to reasons such as inherent model uncertainties and complex floating-point computations. Extending the recent work on analyzing the unit tests written by the developers of the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), we report in this paper the investigation of both unit and regression tests of SWMM. The results show that the 1,458 SWMM tests have a 54.0% code coverage and an 82.4% User's Manual coverage. Meanwhile, an examination of eight regression tests from a test set shows a 79.5% code coverage and a near 100% User's Manual coverage. We also observe a ""getter-setter-getter"" testing pattern from the SWMM unit tests and suggest a diversified way of designing or adopting regression tests.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Peng, Z., X.

Sixteen flights over three days in June 2019 provided emission factors for a broad range of compounds including carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen oxide (NO2), particulate matter < 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including carbonyls, black carbon, and elemental/organic carbon. To our knowledge, this is the first UAS-based emission sampling for a fire of this magnitude, including both slash pile and crown fires resulting in wildfire-like conditions. The burns consisted of drip torch ignitions as well as ground-mobile and aerial helicopter ignitions of large stands comprising over 1,000 ha, allowing for comparison of same-species emission factors burned under different conditions. The use of a UAS for emission sampling minimizes risk to personnel and equipment, allowing flexibility in sampling location and ensuring capture of representative, fresh smoke constituents. PM2.5 emission factors varied 5-fold and, like most pollutants, varied inversely with combustion efficiency resulting in lower emission factors from the slash piles than the crown fires.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Aurell, J., B.

This study used several bioassays and quantitative chemical analyses to assess residence-time weighted samples at six sites along a river in the northeastern United States beginning upstream from a wastewater treatment plant outfall and proceeding downstream along the stream reach to a drinking water treatment plant. Known steroidal estrogens were quantified and changes in signaling pathway molecular initiating events (activation of estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, peroxisome proliferator-activated, pregnane X receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling networks) were identified in water extracts. In initial multi-endpoint assays geographic and receptor-specific endocrine activity patterns in transcription factor signatures and nuclear receptor activation were discovered. In subsequent single endpoint receptor-specific bioassays, estrogen (16 of 18 samples, 0.01 to 28 ng estradiol equivalents [E2Eqs]/L) glucocorticoid (3 of 18 samples, 1.8 to 21 ng dexamethasone equivalents [DexEqs]/L), and androgen (2 of 18 samples, 0.95 to 2.1 ng dihydrotestosterone equivalents [DHTEqs]/L) receptor transcriptional activation occurred above respective assay method detection limits (0.04 ng E2Eqs/L, 1.2 ng DexEqs/L, and 0.77 ng DHTEqs/L) in multiple sampling events. Estrogen activity, the most often detected, correlated well with measured concentrations of known steroidal estrogens (r2 = 0.890). Overall, activity indicative of multiple types of endocrine active compounds was highest in wastewater effluent samples, while activity downstream was progressively lower, and negligible in unfinished treated drinking water. Not only was estrogenic and glucocorticoid activity confirmed in the effluent by utilizing multiple methods concurrently, but other activated signaling networks that historically received less attention (i.e. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) were also detected.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Medlock Kakaley, E., B.

",Quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) and machine learning models for abiotic reduction of organic compounds by an aqueous Fe(II) complex,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Due to the increasing diversity of organic contaminants discharged into anoxic water environments, reactivity prediction is necessary for chemical persistence evaluation for water treatment and risk assessment purposes. Almost all quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) that describe rates of contaminant transformation apply only to narrowly-defined, relatively homogenous families of reactants (e.g., dechlorination of alkyl halides). In this work, we develop predictive models for abiotic reduction of 60 organic compounds with diverse reducible functional groups, including nitroaromatic compounds (NACs), aliphatic nitro-compounds (ANCs), aromatic N-oxides (ANOs), isoxazoles (ISXs), polyhalogenated alkanes (PHAs), sulfoxides and sulfones (SOs), and others. Rate constants for their reduction were measured using a model reductant system, Fe(II)-tiron. Qualitatively, the rates followed the order NACs > ANOs  ISXs  PHAs > ANCs > SOs. To develop QSARs, both conventional chemical descriptor-based and machine learning (ML)-based approaches were investigated. Conventional univariate QSARs based on a molecular descriptor ELUMO (energy of the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital) gave good correlations within classes. Multivariate QSARs combining ELUMO with Abraham descriptors for physico-chemical properties gave slightly improved correlations within classes for NCs and NACs, but little improvement in correlation within other classes or among classes. The ML model obtained covers reduction rates for all classes of compounds and all of the conditions studied with the prediction accuracy similar to those of the conventional QSARs for individual classes (r2 = 0.41-0.98 for univariate QSARs, 0.71-0.94 for multivariate QSARs, and 0.83 for the ML model). Both approaches required a scheme for a priori classification of the compounds for model training. This work offers two alternative modelling approaches to comprehensive abiotic reactivity prediction for persistence evaluation of organic compounds in anoxic water environments.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Gao, Y., S.

","Rapid production of highly oxidized molecules in isoprene aerosol via peroxy and alkoxy radical isomerization pathways in low and high NOx environments: Combined laboratory, computational and field studies",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Recently, we identified seven novel hydroxy-carboxylic acids resulting from gas-phase reactions of isoprene in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3), and/or hydroxyl radicals (OH). In the present study, we provide evidence that hydroxy-carboxylic acids, namely methyltartaric acids (MTA) are: (1) reliable isoprene tracers, (2) likely produced via rapid peroxy radical hydrogen atom(H) shift reactions (autoxidation mechanism) and analogous alkoxy radical H shifts in low and high NOx environments respectively and (3) representative of aged ambient aerosol in the low NOx regime. Firstly, MTA are reliable tracers of isoprene aerosol because they have been identified in numerous chamber experiments involving isoprene conducted under a wide range of conditions and are absent in the oxidation of mono- and sesquiterpenes. They are also present in numerous samples of ambient aerosol collected during the past 20 years at several locations in the U.S. and Europe. Furthermore, MTA concentrations measured during a year-long field study in Research Triangle Park (RTP), NC in 2003 show a seasonal trend consistent with isoprene emissions and photochemical activity. Secondly, an analysis of chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) data of several chamber experiments in low and high NOx environments show that highly oxidized molecules (HOMs) derived from isoprene that lead to MTAs may be produced rapidly and considered as early generation isoprene oxidation products in the gas phase. Density functional theory calculations show that rapid intramolecular H shifts involving peroxy and alkoxy radicals possess low barriers for methyl-hydroxy-butenals (MHBs) that may represent precursors for MTA. From these results, a viable rapid H shift mechanism is proposed to occur that produces isoprene derived HOMs like MTA. Finally, an analysis of the mechanism shows that autoxidation-like pathways in low and high NOx may produce HOMs in a few OH oxidation steps like commonly detected methyl tetrol (MT) isoprene tracers. The ratio of MTA/MT in isoprene aerosol is also shown to be significantly greater in field versus chamber samples indicating the importance of such pathways in the atmosphere even for smaller hydrocarbons like isoprene.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Jaoui, M., I.

",Total column NO2 from ground based pandora spectrometers at nine locations across the New York City metropolitan.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Airborne and ground-based Pandora spectrometer NO2 column measurements were collected during the 2018 Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS) in the New York City/Long Island Sound region, which coincided with early observations from the Sentinel-5P TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument. Both airborne- and ground-based measurements are used to evaluate the TROPOMI NO2 Tropospheric Vertical Column (TrVC) product v1.2 in this region, which has high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in NO2. First, airborne and Pandora TrVCs are compared to evaluate the uncertainty of the airborne TrVC and establish the spatial representativeness of the Pandora observations. The 171 coincidences between Pandora and airborne TrVCs are found to be highly correlated (r2= 0.92 and slope of 1.03), with the largest individual differences being associated with high temporal and/or spatial variability. These reference measurements (Pandora and airborne) are complementary with respect to temporal coverage and spatial representativity. Pandora spectrometers can provide continuous long-term measurements but may lack areal representativity when operated in direct-sun mode. Airborne spectrometers are typically only deployed for short periods of time, but their observations are more spatially representative of the satellite measurements with the added capability of retrieving at subpixel resolutions of 250 m x 250 m over the entire TROPOMI pixels they overfly. Thus, airborne data are more correlated with TROPOMI measurements (r2=0.96) than Pandora measurements are with TROPOMI (r2=0.84). The largest outliers between TROPOMI and the reference measurements appear to stem from too spatially coarse a priori surface reflectivity (0.5) over bright urban scenes. In this work, this results during cloud-free scenes that, at times, are affected by errors in the TROPOMI cloud pressure retrieval impacting the calculation of tropospheric air mass factors. This factor causes a high bias in TROPOMI TrVCs of 4 %-11 %. Excluding these cloud-impacted points, TROPOMI has an overall low bias of 19 %-33 % during the LISTOS timeframe of June-September 2018. Part of this low bias is caused by coarse a priori profile input from the TM5-MP model, replacing these profiles with those from a 12 km North American Model-Community Multiscale Air Quality (NAMCMAQ) analysis results in a 12 %-14 % increase in the TrVCs. Even with this improvement, the TROPOMI-NAMCMAQ TrVCs have a 7 %-19 % low bias, indicating needed improvement in a priori assumptions in the air mass factor calculation. Future work should explore additional impacts of a priori inputs to further assess the remaining low biases in TROPOMI using these datasets.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Judd, L., J.

",Maumee River 2012 and 2016,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The Maumee River and associated tributaries are an example of a system influenced by a mosaic of contaminant inputs from point and nonpoint sources along a gradient of land uses. To assess the potential effects of contaminants on aquatic biota in a system this complex requires a combination of targeted and nontargeted analytical and biological monitoring techniques to provide data that can be assembled and interpreted in an integrated manner. The aim of the current paper was to provide a practical demonstration of this type of approach using a variety of state-of-the-science pathway-based tools. Studies conducted in 2012 and 2106 showed that contaminants in the upper part of the Maumee River reflect agricultural practices, while downstream, the suite of chemicals present includes those from agriculture in conjunction with contaminants more indicative of a general urban setting, influenced in some areas by WWTP inputs. Biological responses using in vitro assays with surface water samples, and measures of biological responses in caged fish deployed a various sites in the Maumee River were used to assess the potential for perturbation of specific biological pathways. Overall there was little evidence for contaminant effects on endocrine pathways involved is reproduction or development. However, multiple lines of evidence suggested the presence of contaminants that could inhibit or induce cytochrome P450-based enzymes thereby influencing biological pathways/processes associated with these ubiquitous proteins.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Ankley, G., J.

Each polygon has attributes that include FID, Name, Number (used in our published map figure and tables), and shape area (in meters squared).US_HLScenarioMerge.shp: We apply the hydrologic landscapes (HL) concept to assess the hydrologic vulnerability of the western United States (U.S.) to projected climate conditions. Our goal is to understand the potential impacts for stakeholder-defined interests across large geographic areas. The basic assumption of the HL approach is that catchments that share similar physical and climatic characteristics are expected to have similar hydrologic characteristics. We map climate vulnerability by integrating the HL approach into a retrospective analysis of historical data to assess variability in future climate projections and hydrology, which includes temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, snow accumulation, climatic moisture, surplus water, and seasonality of water surplus. This paper illustrates how the HL approach can help assess climatic and hydrologic vulnerability across large spatial scales. By combining the HL concept and climate vulnerability analyses, we provide a planning approach that could allow resource managers to consider how future climate conditions may impact important economic and conservation resources. The data in this data set provides the Feddema Moisture Index, classified climate class, and classified season class for each time decade and 30 yr normal period from 1900-2010 and the 10 analyzed climate model projections described in the manuscript.",Enviromental Data,Enviromental Data,,,,,,,,,,,,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD)'s dataset - 'Hydrologic Landscape Vulnerability Assessment Data' provides Enviromental Data.

LCIA methods are collections of characterization factors, which are measures of relative potency or potential impact, for a given flow (e.g., NH3 to air) for a set of impact categories (e.g., acidification), provided in units of potency or impact equivalents per unit mass of the flowable associated with a given context (e.g., 1.88 kg SO2 eq/kg NH3 emitted to air). LCIA methods are typically used along with life cycle inventory data to estimate potential impacts in life cycle assessment (LCA). ReCiPe2016 produces 18 midpoint indicators and 3 endpoint indicators, and both midpoint and endpoint are provided using Individualist (I), Hierarchist (H), and Egalitarian (E) cultural perspectives.The FEDEFL or Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List (EPA 2019) is the standardized elementary flow list for use with data meeting the US Federal LCA Commons data guidelines.In this dataset, ReCiPe2016 is applied to FEDEFL v1.0.7 flows.

The test chemicals were selected to provide broad coverage across the industrial and pesticidal chemical space while also prioritizing chemicals of interest to EPA's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). A data evaluation framework was developed to identify results suitable for rate reporting. Acceptable results were then used to evaluate the chemical domain of applicability of the applied methods, the influence of starting substrate concentration on measured rates of intrinsic clearance, and differences in metabolic activity among species. These findings provide data for chemicals of specific interest to the EDSP.

S., Fann, N., ""Regional Temperature-Ozone Relationships Across the U.S. Under Multiple Climate and Emissions Scenarios,"" 2020.MODEL VERSION AND CONFIGURATIONThe Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used. The model is open source and can be freely downloaded at http://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ. The specific code version used in this study was based on a pre-release version of CMAQ 5.3, with minor modifications to accommodate the USGS28 land-use scheme used in WRF. The model source code is included in the ""src"" directory.The meteorological input data for CMAQ were derived from outputs of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Coupled Model version 3 (CM3) following Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which represents a relatively high warming scenario. The CESM and CM3 fields were downscaled to 36-km grid cells over North America using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The downscaling and air quality modeling procedure are described in the associated manuscript (Nolte et al., submitted manuscript, 2020) and references therein.CMAQ simulations were conducted using the meteorology downscaled from the two climate models and using two different sets of anthropogenic emissions: the 2011 National Emission Inventory and a 2040 projection developed for analysis of the Heavy Duty Greenhouse Gas Rule. This 2040 projection represents significant reductions relative to present-day of pollutant emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). See U.S. EPA (2016) for further information on the anthropogenic emissions. Climate-sensitive VOCs emitted from vegetation, e.g., isoprene, were modeled within CMAQ using the downscaled meteorological projections from WRF.CMAQ was used to simulate air pollutant concentrations over the continental United States using grid cells with 36km x 36km horizontal spacing, with the height of the lowest model layer around 38 m. Further details on the model configuration and input data are described in the manuscript.Figures used in this paper were prepared using version 3.6.1 of the R programming language.

","Dataset from ""Regional Ozone-Temperature Relationships Across the U.S. Under Multiple Climate and Emissions Scenarios"", by Nolte et al.",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This file describes the dataset used in the following article:Nolte, C. G., Spero, T. L., Bowden, J. H., Sarofim, M. C., Martinich, J., Mallard, M. S., Fann, N., ""Regional Temperature-Ozone Relationships Across the U.S. Under Multiple Climate and Emissions Scenarios,"" 2020.MODEL VERSION AND CONFIGURATIONThe Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used. The model is open source and can be freely downloaded at http://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ. The specific code version used in this study was based on a pre-release version of CMAQ 5.3, with minor modifications to accommodate the USGS28 land-use scheme used in WRF. The model source code is included in the ""src"" directory.The meteorological input data for CMAQ were derived from outputs of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Coupled Model version 3 (CM3) following Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which represents a relatively high warming scenario. The CESM and CM3 fields were downscaled to 36-km grid cells over North America using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The downscaling and air quality modeling procedure are described in the associated manuscript (Nolte et al., submitted manuscript, 2020) and references therein.CMAQ simulations were conducted using the meteorology downscaled from the two climate models and using two different sets of anthropogenic emissions: the 2011 National Emission Inventory and a 2040 projection developed for analysis of the Heavy Duty Greenhouse Gas Rule. This 2040 projection represents significant reductions relative to present-day of pollutant emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). See U.S. EPA (2016) for further information on the anthropogenic emissions. Climate-sensitive VOCs emitted from vegetation, e.g., isoprene, were modeled within CMAQ using the downscaled meteorological projections from WRF.CMAQ was used to simulate air pollutant concentrations over the continental United States using grid cells with 36km x 36km horizontal spacing, with the height of the lowest model layer around 38 m. Further details on the model configuration and input data are described in the manuscript.Figures used in this paper were prepared using version 3.6.1 of the R programming language. R is open source, and can be downloaded at www.r-project.org. The R scripts are labeled according to their figure number, and reference all data needed to generate the figures, which are located in the ""figs"" folder.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Nolte, C., T.

","Datasets associated with ""Mining of Consumer Product and Purchasing Data to Identify Potential Chemical Co-exposures""",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Background: Chemicals in consumer products are a major contributor to human chemical co-exposures. Consumers purchase and use a wide variety of products containing potentially thousands of chemicals. There is a need to identify potential real-world chemical co-exposures in order to prioritize in vitro toxicity screening. However, due to the vast number of potential chemical combinations, this has been a major challenge.Objectives: We aim to develop and implement a data-driven procedure for identifying prevalent chemical combinations to which humans are exposed through purchase and use of consumer products.Methods: We applied frequent itemset mining on an integrated dataset linking consumer product chemical ingredient data with product purchasing data from sixty thousand households to identify chemical combinations resulting from co-use of consumer products.Results: We identified co-occurrence patterns of chemicals over all households as well as those specific to demographic groups based on race/ethnicity, income, education, and family composition. We also identified chemicals with the highest potential for aggregate exposure by identifying chemicals occurring in multiple products used by the same household. Lastly, a case study of chemicals active in estrogen and androgen receptor in silico models revealed priority chemical combinations co-targeting receptors involved in important biological signaling pathways.Discussion: Integration and comprehensive analysis of household purchasing data and product-chemical information provided a means to assess human near-field exposure and inform selection of chemical combinations for high-throughput screening in in vitro assays.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Stanfield, Z., C.

",Properties that influence pond-breeding salamander density and predation in midwestern United States ephemeral wetlands,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Ephemeral wetlands provide habitat for a variety of taxa and are often critical breeding locations for amphibians. Although the impacts of abiotic properties of wetlands on amphibians have been extensively tested, data regarding how biological characteristics of ephemeral wetlands shape amphibian populations is lacking. Across a series of wetlands, we captured and sampled larval pond-breeding salamanders and aquatic invertebrates, and quantified diet items of salamanders to examine what properties influence densities of larval salamanders, aquatic invertebrates, and properties that drive predation of salamanders on aquatic invertebrates. We found site-level and landscape-level properties influenced salamander and invertebrate densities. Our data suggest larval salamanders have a predation bias for and against certain taxa in wetlands. Salamanders selected against predation of invertebrate predators and selected primarily for the collector-filterer functional group. Despite these preferences, salamander predation did not have measurable influence on aquatic invertebrate density. Furthermore, although pond-breeding salamanders can reach high densities in ephemeral wetlands and select for specific prey items, they do not have measurable influence over macroinvertebrate community structure.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Struecker, B., J.

",European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies can affect terrestrial precipitation via ocean-atmosphere interaction known as climate teleconnection. Non-stationary and non-linear characteristics of the ocean-atmosphere system make the identification of the teleconnection signals difficult to be detected at a local scale as it could cause large uncertainties when using linear correlation analysis only. This paper explores the relationship between global SST and terrestrial precipitation with respect to long-term non-stationary teleconnection signals during 1981-2010 over three regions in North America and one in Central America. Empirical mode decomposition as well as wavelet analysis is utilized to extract the intrinsic trend and the dominant oscillation of the SST and precipitation time series in sequence. After finding possible associations between the dominant oscillation of seasonal precipitation and global SST through lagged correlation analysis, the statistically significant SST regions are extracted based on the correlation coefficient. With these characterized associations, individual contribution of these SST forcing regions linked to the related precipitation responses are further quantified through nonlinear modeling with the aid of extreme learning machine. Results indicate that the non-leading SST regions also contribute a salient portion to the terrestrial precipitation variability compared to some known leading SST regions. In some cases, these estimated contributions reveals some clues of the coupling interactions between oceanic and atmospheric processes.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Chang, N., S.

EPA program offices, faced with applications for novel engineered nanomaterials, need access to relevant data to help predict potential environmental/biological interactions of nanomaterials based on their physio-chemical properties and the intended uses of novel materials. We have developed a relational database containing the results from the Office of Research and Development (ORD) regarding the actions of engineered nanomaterials in environmental and biological systems. The database captures the chemical and physical parameters of the materials tested, the assays in which they were tested, and the measured results. The database is designed to enable selective searches of nanomaterials based on physical/chemical parameters such as composition, size, coatings, etc, the system in which they were tested, and the quantitative results obtained. For example, a user would be able to access information on materials of similar composition, size range, reactivity, or other properties measured, and see what results were observed.

",Metadata for Coral Reef Resilience Assessment for Puerto Rico,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Climate change threatens coral reefs through multiple pathways and interactions with local stressors. More resilient reefs have a higher likelihood of returning to a coral-dominated state following disturbance. To advance practical approaches to reef resilience assessments and aid resilience-based management of coral reefs, we conducted a resilience assessment for Puerto Rico's coral reefs modified from methods used in other U.S. jurisdictions. We calculated relative resilience scores for 103 sites from an existing commonwealth-wide survey using eight resilience indicators and identified which indicators most drove resilience. We found that sites of very different relative resilience were generally highly intermixed, underscoring the importance and necessity of decision making and management at fine scales. In combination with information on levels of two localized stressors (fishing pressure and pollution exposure), we used the resilience indicators to assess which of seven potential management actions could be used at each site to maintain or improve resilience. Fishery management was the management action that applied to the most sites. Furthermore, we combined sites' resilience scores with ocean warming predictions to assign sites to vulnerability categories. Island-wide or local managers can use the actions and vulnerability information as a starting point for resilience-based management of their reefs. This assessment differs from many previous ones because we tested how much information could be yielded by a ""desktop"" assessment using freely-available, existing data rather than from a customized, resilience-focused field survey. The available data still permitted analyses comparable to previous assessments, demonstrating that desktop resilience assessments can substitute for assessments with field components under some circumstances.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Gibbs, D., and J.

",Full data appendix,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"General cognitive ability, often referred to as 'general intelligence', comprises a variety of correlated abilities. Childhood general cognitive ability is a well-studied area of research and can be used to predict social outcomes and perceived success. Early life stage (e.g., prenatal, postnatal, toddler) exposures to stressors (i.e., chemical and non-chemical stressors from the total (built, natural, social) environment) can impact the development of childhood cognitive ability. Building from our systematic scoping review (Ruiz et al., 2016), we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate more than 100 stressors related to cognitive development. Our meta-analysis identified 23 stressors with a significant increase in their likelihood to influence childhood cognitive ability by 10% or more, and 80 stressors were observed to have a statistically significant effect on cognitive ability. Stressors most impactful to cognition during the prenatal period were related to maternal health and the mother's ability to access information relevant to a healthy pregnancy (e.g., diet, lifestyle). Stressors most impactful to cognition during the early childhood period were dietary nutrients (infancy), quality of social interaction (toddler), and exposure to toxic substances (throughout early childhood). In conducting this analysis, we examined the relative impact of real-world exposures on cognitive development to attempt to understand the inter-relationships between exposures to both chemical and non-chemical stressors and early developmental life stages. Our findings suggest that the stressors observed to be the most influential to childhood cognitive ability are not permanent and can be broadly categorized as activities/behaviors which can be modified to improve childhood cognition. This meta-analysis supports the idea that there are complex relationships between a child's total environment and early cognitive development.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Nilsen, F., J. Ruiz, and N. Tulve. A Meta-Analysis of Stressors from the Total Environment Associated with Children's General Cognitive Ability. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

The model is open source and can be freely downloaded at http://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ. The specific code version used in this study was based on a pre-release version of CMAQ 5.3, with minor modifications to accommodate the USGS28 land-use scheme used in WRF. The model source code is included in the ""src"" directory.The meteorological input data for CMAQ were derived from outputs of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Coupled Model version 3 (CM3) following Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, which represents a relatively high warming scenario. The CESM and CM3 fields were downscaled to 36-km grid cells over North America using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The downscaling and air quality modeling procedure are described in the associated manuscript (Nolte et al., submitted manuscript, 2020) and references therein.CMAQ simulations were conducted using the meteorology downscaled from the two climate models and using two different sets of anthropogenic emissions: the 2011 National Emission Inventory and a 2040 projection developed for analysis of the Heavy Duty Greenhouse Gas Rule. This 2040 projection represents significant reductions relative to present-day of pollutant emissions, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). See U.S. EPA (2016) for further information on the anthropogenic emissions. Climate-sensitive VOCs emitted from vegetation, e.g., isoprene, were modeled within CMAQ using the downscaled meteorological projections from WRF.CMAQ was used to simulate air pollutant concentrations over the continental United States using grid cells with 36km x 36km horizontal spacing, with the height of the lowest model layer around 38 m. Further details on the model configuration and input data are described in the manuscript.Figures used in this paper were prepared using version 3.6.1 of the R programming language.

This product represents updates to the NaKnowBase database, which has been cleared under STICS Public accessibility for NaKnowBase ORD-043098.The first component is a tool to automate formatting of ENM data into the standard and universally accepted ISO-TAB Nano format. We have written this code to both WRITE (export) NKB data in ISO-TAB Nano format, as well as READ (input) external data already in the ISO-TAB Nano format for potential inclusion into NKB. The code and corresponding documentation for this tool are made available to the public via the EPA Office of Research and Development at: https://gaftp.epa.gov/EPADataCommons/ORD/NaKnowBase/.The second component is an application, entitled ""OntoSearcher"", that automates ontological term mapping for a given ENM dataset. We have developed this code to read in external partner ENM data, and map those data to ontological terms with reported diagnostics on speed and accuracy. This is the first step in the development of a common language for ENMs, aims to minimize necessary human curation time and is critical to EPA efforts to integrate across Federal ENM datasets in a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Accessible) way. The code and corresponding documentation for this application are made available to the public via the EPA Office of Research and Development at: https://gaftp.epa.gov/EPADataCommons/ORD/NaKnowBase/. The third component is the integration of NaKnowBase ENM data with the EPA Chemistry Dashboard. Currently, we have 373 chemical structure mapped on the Dashboard at https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/chemical_lists/NAKNOWBASE. This collaborative, intra-Agency effort between CCTE and CPHEA continues as we update NKB ENMs, establish web-services to update NKB-Dashboard integration with the NKB application, build on our EPA standard nomenclature for ENMs (Beach et al.(2021)), and continue our semantic mapping efforts with Federal and International collaborators.",Enviromental Data,Enviromental Data,,,,,,,,,,,,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD)'s dataset - 'CSS.3.2.2.1 NaKnowBase' provides Enviromental Data.

After isolation of A. hydrillicola from environmental samples and adaptation to laboratory conditions, the cyanobacterium was cultivated in BG11 medium with or without the addition of potassium bromide. H. verticillata leaves colonized with A. hydrillicola were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy as well as AP-MALDI-MSI (9-AA as matrix in negative-ionization mode, lateral resolution, 10 mm). Environmental bromide and bromine concentrations in H. verticillata, sediment, and water samples were analyzed by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and ion chromatography. The structure of AETX was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography after isolation of the compound using flash chromatography, semipreparative HPLC, and recrystallization. The genome of A. hydrillicola was amplified from single filaments using multiple displacement amplification and then sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The putative AETX biosynthetic gene cluster was identified by BLASTp searches for bacterial halogenases against the A. hydrillicola genome. The halogenase AetF was heterologously expressed in E. coli and then purified. Biochemical assays to characterize its activity used tryptophans and indoles as substrates. Reaction products were structurally characterized by HPLC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. A. hydrillicola-H. verticillata extract fractions and pure AETX were tested for activity on C. dubia, D. rerio, C. elegans, and G. gallus. Bioassays on D. rerio and G. gallus were performed in accordance with the National Insitutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and followed protocol A2017 11-007-Y1-A0, which was reviewed, approved, and overseen by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. VM occurrence in treated birds was confirmed by analysis of the white matter of their optic lobe using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.

The role of ABCG2 during early embryonic development, however, is not established.

ABCG2 was found to serve protective role in mESC as a xenobiotic transporter. The role of ABCG2 in regulating redox status, however, was unclear.

",BSEE Linear Boom In Situ Oil Burn Data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The efficiency of simulated at-sea surface oil burns (in situ burns, ISB) was determined while testing varied boom configurations and air-assist nozzles to improve combustion. Tests were conducted in a 14.3 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m tank under both calm and wave-action conditions. Emissions and residual uncombusted oil were sampled to characterize the effect of variations in boom length/width ratios, injection air, and presence or absence of waves. Tests were done with 30 L of Alaska North Slope oil within an outdoor, above ground, fresh water, 63 m3 tank equipped with wave actuators and baffles. The combustion plume was sampled for emissions using a crane-suspended instrument system. Combustion efficiencies based on unburned carbon in the plume emissions ranged from 85% to 93%. Efficiencies based on oil mass loss ranged from 89% to 99% but were not predicted by changes in boom ratio, air injection, or the presence of waves. A four-fold variation in PM2.5 emission factors was observed from the test conditions and the most effective burns in terms of reduced emissions were those that had high length to width boom ratios resulting in higher flame front surface area exposure to ambient air. The presence of added injection air near the oil/water/flame interface had no statistical effect on the combustion efficiency, suggesting that added oxygen and air-induced turbulence at the oil/flame interface was not limiting the combustion rate. The presence of waves had a limited detrimental effect on combustion emissions, possibly caused by enhancing heat loss from the burning oil to the water below. Post-burn, residual oil samples were collected and analyzed to show that the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentration in the residuals decreased as the oil mass loss increased. The amount of oil mass lost was not related to any combustion efficiency parameters or pollutant levels. However, TPH in residues were significantly lower at higher boom ratios in the control and air plus waves tests.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Aurell, J., A. Holder, B.

These include a flat and hierarchical structure of the five balancing criteria, shown in Table 4 and Table 5, respectively. Table 4 provides a comprehensive score for each balancing criterion, similar to the summary tables presented in the FS of Superfund sites (e.g., (EPA 2016b, AECOM 2019)). Table 5 uses the same information in Table 3, but in this case, each piece of information is used to define multiple sub-criteria for each balancing criterion, except the cost one. This leads to a much more elaborate information table with the four remaining balancing criteria, now characterized by 13 sub-criteria.It is important to note that the scoring provided in Table 4 and Table 5, with the exception of the cost (c_5), were derived from the author's interpretation of the descriptive language of the detailed analysis in for the hypothetical case study in presented in Table A-7 in Appendix A of the guidance document of EPA (1988b). It should be noted that the analysis of the three remedy alternatives presented in this hypothetical case study is governed by site-specific characteristics and may not represent potential performance of these remediation alternatives for other sites . The intent of this exercise is to illustrate the flexibility and adaptability of the MCDA process to address both the main, overarching criteria, as well as sub-criteria that may have specific importance in the decision process for a particular site. Ultimately, the sub-criteria can be adapted to address specific stakeholder perspectives or technical factors that may be linked to properties unique to the contaminant or physical characteristics of the site.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Cinelli, M., M.A. Gonzalez, R.

",Evaluation of Existing QSAR Models and Structural Alerts and Development of New Ensemble Models for Genotoxicity Using a Newly Compiled Experimental Dataset,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"In this study, a major effort was undertaken to compile a large genotoxicity dataset (54,805 records for 9299 substances) from several public sources (e.g., TOXNET, COSMOS, eChemPortal). The names and outcomes of the different assays were harmonized, and assays were annotated by type: gene mutation in Salmonella bacteria (Ames assay) and chromosome mutation (clastogenicity) in vitro or in vivo (chromosome aberration, micronucleus, and mouse lymphoma Tk+/- assays). This dataset was then evaluated to assess genotoxic potential using a categorization scheme, whereby a substance was considered genotoxic if it was positive in at least one Ames or clastogen study. The categorization dataset comprised 8442 chemicals, of which 2728 chemicals were genotoxic, 5585 were not and 129 were inconclusive. QSAR models (TEST and VEGA) and the OECD Toolbox structural alerts/profilers (e.g., OASIS DNA alerts for Ames and chromosomal aberrations) were used to make in silico predictions of genotoxicity potential. The performance of the individual QSAR tools and structural alerts resulted in balanced accuracies of 57-73%. A Naive Bayes consensus model was developed using combinations of QSAR models and structural alert predictions. The 'best' consensus model selected had a balanced accuracy of 81.2%, a sensitivity of 87.24% and a specificity of 75.20%. This in silico scheme offers promise as a first step in ranking thousands of substances as part of a prioritization approach for genotoxicity.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Pradeep, P., R.

","On Tracer Breakthrough Curve Dataset Size, Shape, and Statistical Distribution",U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"A tracer breakthrough curve (BTC) for each sampling station is the ultimate goal of every quantitative hydrologic tracing study, and dataset size can critically affect the BTC. Groundwater-tracing data obtained using in situ automatic sampling or detection devices may result in very high-density data sets. Data-dense tracer BTCs obtained using in situ devices and stored in dataloggers can result in visually cluttered overlapping data points. The relatively large amounts of data detected by high-frequency settings available on in situ devices and stored in dataloggers ensure that important tracer BTC features, such as data peaks, are not missed. Alternatively, such dense datasets can also be difficult to interpret. Even more difficult, is the application of such dense data sets in solute-transport models that may not be able to adequately reproduce tracer BTC shapes due to the overwhelming mass of data. One solution to the difficulties associated with analyzing, interpreting, and modeling dense data sets is the selective removal of blocks of the data from the total dataset. Although it is possible to arrange to skip blocks of tracer BTC data in a periodic sense (data decimation) so as to lessen the size and density of the dataset, skipping or deleting blocks of data also may result in missing the important features that the high-frequency detection setting efforts were intended to detect. Rather than removing, reducing, or reformulating data overlap, signal filtering and smoothing may be utilized but smoothing errors (e.g., averaging errors, outliers, and potential time shifts) need to be considered. Appropriate probability distributions to tracer BTCs may be used to describe typical tracer BTC shapes, which usually include long tails. Recognizing appropriate probability distributions applicable to tracer BTCs can help in understanding some aspects of the tracer migration.This dataset is associated with the following publications: Field, M.

Understanding the impact of varying degrees of electric vehicle adoption and CO2 intensities on emission reduction in the city is critical. Here, using a technology-rich, bottom-up, energy system optimization model, we analyze cost and air emission impacts of New York City's proposed CO2 reduction policies for the transportation sector through a scenario framework. Our analysis reveals electrification of light-duty vehicles at earlier periods are essential for deeper reductions in air emissions. When further combined with energy efficiency improvements, these actions contribute to CO2 reductions under the scenarios of higher CO2 intense electricity. Significant reliance on fossil fuels and a need for structural change pose challenges to cost-effective CO2 reductions in the transportation sector. Here we found that uncertainties associated with decarbonization of the electric grid has minimum influence on cost-effectiveness of CO2 reduction pathways for transportation sector.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Isik, M., R.

This work has included development of the HL classification framework and its application to Oregon, use of the HL classes to predict where a simple lumped hydrologic model accurately predicts daily streamflow, use of HL information to model the presence of cold-water patches at tributary confluences, and combining Oregon HL results with temperature and precipitation predictions to examine how HLs would vary as a result of climate change. As a part of the current work, the HL approach has been expanded to the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, and Idaho) based on a revision of the approach that makes it more broadly applicable. This revised approach has several advantages compared with the original approach: it is not limited to areas that have an aquifer permeability map, it uses a flexible approach to converting a nationally available geospatial dataset into assessment units, and it is more robust. These improvements should allow the revised HL approach to be applied more often in situations requiring hydrologic classification, and allow greater confidence in results. This effort paves the way for a climate change analysis for the Pacific Northwest that is currently underway, as well as expansion into the southwest (California, Arizona, and Nevada).

Despite, the wealth of toxicological data for this organism, until recently genome scale information was lacking for the species, which limited the utility of the species for pathway-based toxicity testing and research. As part of a EPA Pathfinder Innovation Project, next generation sequencing was applied to generate a draft genome assembly, which was published in 2016. However, application of those genome-scale sequencing resources was still limited by the lack of available gene annotations for fathead minnow. Here we report on development of a first generation genome annotation for fathead minnow and the dissemination of that information through a web-based browser that makes it easy to search for genes of interest, extract the corresponding sequence, identify intron and exon boundaries and regulatory regions, and align the computationally predicted genes with other supporting evidence. This work greatly enhances the utility of the genome assemblies that were developed and makes it accessible to the ecotoxicology community world-wide, opening up a wide array of new research opportunities with the species.

",Read_Across_Prediction_of_Estrogenicity_for_Hindered_Phenols_2017_Data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Read-across is an important data gap filling technique used within category and analog approaches for regulatory hazard identification and risk assessment. Although much technical guidance is available that describes how to develop category/analog approaches, practical principles to evaluate and substantiate analog validity (suitability) are still lacking. This case study uses hindered phenols as an example chemical class to determine: (1) the capability of three structure fingerprint/descriptor methods (PubChem, ToxPrints and MoSS MCSS) to identify analogs for read-across to predict Estrogen Receptor (ER) binding activity and, (2) the utility of data confidence measures, physicochemical properties, and chemical R-group properties as filters to improve ER binding predictions. The training dataset comprised 462 hindered phenols and 257 non- hindered phenols. For each chemical of interest (target), source analogs were identified from two datasets (hindered and non-hindered phenols) that had been characterized by a fingerprint/descriptor method and by two cut-offs: (1) minimum similarity distance (range: 0.1 - 0.9) and, (2) N closest analogs (range: 1 - 10). Analogs were then filtered using: (1) physicochemical properties of the phenol (termed global filtering) and, (2) physicochemical properties of the R-groups neighboring the active hydroxyl group (termed local filtering). A read-across prediction was made for each target chemical on the basis of a majority vote of the N closest analogs. The results demonstrate that: (1) concordance in ER activity increases with structural similarity, regardless of the structure fingerprint/descriptor method, (2) increased data confidence significantly improves read-across predictions, and (3) filtering analogs using global and local properties can help identify more suitable analogs. This case study illustrates that the quality of the underlying experimental data and use of endpoint relevant chemical descriptors to evaluate source analogs are critical to achieving robust read-across predictions.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Pradeep, P., K.

In this study, we selected three different types of expert systems: VEGA (statistical), Derek Nexus (knowledge based), TIMES-SS (hybrid) and evaluated their performance using 2 large datasets of substances that had been assessed for their skin sensitisation potential in animal models. We considered a model to be successful at predicting skin sensitisation potential if it had at least the same balanced accuracy as the LLNA and the GPMT had in predicting the outcomes of one another, which ranged from 79% to 86% depending on the dataset. We found that none of the expert systems evaluated was able to achieve such a high balanced accuracy in their global predictions, with balanced accuracies ranging from 56% to 65%. However, for substances within the domain of TIMES-SS, balanced accuracies were found to be 79% and 82%, for the two datasets, in line with the animal data. The expert systems evaluated could be extended in light of the additional data collected as part of this study. The incorrect predictions offer new insights for how the existing alerts within these expert systems could be refined. These datasets also offer exciting opportunities for the development of new models.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Fitzpatrick, J., D. Roberts, and G. Patlewicz.

",Linking high resolution mass spectrometry data with exposure and toxicity forecasts to advance high-throughput environmental monitoring,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"There is a growing need in the field of exposure science for monitoring methods that rapidly screen environmental media for suspect contaminants. Measurement and analysis platforms, based on high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), now exist to meet this need. Here we describe results of a study that links HRMS data with exposure predictions from the U.S. EPA's ExpoCast(tm) program and in vitro bioassay data from the U.S. interagency Tox21 consortium. Vacuum dust samples were collected from 56 households across the U.S. as part of the American Healthy Homes Survey (AHHS). Sample extracts were analyzed using liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF/MS) with electrospray ionization. On average, approximately 2000 molecular features were identified per sample (based on accurate mass) in negative ion mode, and 3000 in positive ion mode. Exact mass, isotope distribution, and isotope spacing were used to match molecular features with a unique listing of chemical formulas extracted from EPA's Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database. A total of 978 DSSTox formulas were consistent with the dust LC-TOF/molecular feature data (match score >= 90), these formulas mapped to 3228 possible chemicals in the database. Correct assignment of a unique chemical to a given formula required additional validation steps. Each suspect chemical was prioritized for follow-up confirmation using abundance and detection frequency results, along with exposure and bioactivity estimates from ExpoCast and Tox21, respectively. Chemicals with elevated exposure and/or toxicity potential were further examined using a mixture of 100 chemical standards. A total of 33 chemicals were confirmed present in the dust samples by formula and retention time match, nearly half of these do not appear to have been associated with house dust in the published literature. Chemical matches found in at least 10 of the 56 dust samples include Piperine, N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), Triclocarban, Diethyl phthalate (DEP), Propylparaben, Methylparaben, Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP), and Nicotine. This study demonstrates a novel suspect screening methodology to prioritize chemicals of interest for subsequent targeted analysis. The methods described here rely on strategic integration of available public resources and should be considered in future non-targeted and suspect screening assessments of environmental and biological media.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Rager, J.E., M.

",Data from Tiered High-Throughput Screening Approach to Identify Thyroperoxidase Inhibitors within the ToxCast Phase I and II Chemical Libraries,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"High-throughput screening for potential thyroid-disrupting chemicals requires a system of assays to capture multiple molecular-initiating events (MIEs) that converge on perturbed thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis. Screening for MIEs specific to TH-disrupting pathways is limited in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ToxCast screening assay portfolio. To fill 1 critical screening gap, the Amplex UltraRed-thyroperoxidase (AUR-TPO) assay was developed to identify chemicals that inhibit TPO, as decreased TPO activity reduces TH synthesis. The ToxCast phase I and II chemical libraries, comprised of 1074 unique chemicals, were initially screened using a single, high concentration to identify potential TPO inhibitors. Chemicals positive in the single-concentration screen were retested in concentration-response. Due to high false-positive rates typically observed with loss-of-signal assays such as AUR-TPO, we also employed 2 additional assays in parallel to identify possible sources of nonspecific assay signal loss, enabling stratification of roughly 300 putative TPO inhibitors based upon selective AUR-TPO activity. A cell-free luciferase inhibition assay was used to identify nonspecific enzyme inhibition among the putative TPO inhibitors, and a cytotoxicity assay using a human cell line was used to estimate the cellular tolerance limit. Additionally, the TPO inhibition activities of 150 chemicals were compared between the AUR-TPO and an orthogonal peroxidase oxidation assay using guaiacol as a substrate to confirm the activity profiles of putative TPO inhibitors. This effort represents the most extensive TPO inhibition screening campaign to date and illustrates a tiered screening approach that focuses resources, maximizes assay throughput, and reduces animal use.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Paul-Friedman, K., E.D.

",Systems Toxicology of Male Reproductive Development: Profiling 774 Chemicals for Molecular Targets and Adverse Outcomes,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Background: Trends in male reproductive health have been reported for increased rates of testicular germ cell tumors, low semen quality, cryptorchidism, and hypospadias, which have been associated with prenatal environmental chemical exposure based on human and animal studies.Objective: In the present study we aimed to identify significant correlations between environmental chemicals, molecular targets, and adverse outcomes across a broad chemical landscape with emphasis on developmental toxicity of the male reproductive system.Methods: We used U.S. EPA's animal study database (ToxRefDB) and a comprehensive literature analysis to identify 774 chemicals that have been evaluated for adverse effects on male reproductive parameters, and then used U.S. EPA's in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) database (ToxCastDB) to profile their bioactivity across approximately 800 molecular and cellular features.Results: A phenotypic hierarchy of testicular atrophy, sperm effects, tumors, and malformations, a composite resembling the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) hypothesis, was observed in 281 chemicals. A subset of 54 chemicals with male developmental consequences had in vitro bioactivity on molecular targets that could be condensed into 156 gene annotations in a bipartite network.Conclusion: Computational modeling of available in vivo and in vitro data for chemicals that produce adverse effects on male reproductive end points revealed a phenotypic hierarchy across animal studies consistent with the human TDS hypothesis. We confirmed the known role of estrogen and androgen signaling pathways in rodent TDS, and importantly, broadened the list of molecular targets to include retinoic acid signaling, vascular remodeling proteins, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and cytochrome P450s.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Leung , M., J.

",Using ToxCast data to reconstruct dynamic cell state trajectories and estimate toxicological points of departure.,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Background: High-content imaging (HCI) allows simultaneous measurement of multiple cellular phenotypic changes and is an important tool for evaluating the biological activity of chemicals. Objectives: Our goal was to analyze dynamic cellular changes using HCI to identify the ""tipping point"" at which the cells did not show recovery towards a normal phenotypic state. Methods: HCI was used to evaluate the effects of 967 chemicals (in concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 200 mM) on HepG2 cells over a 72-hr exposure period. The HCI end points included p53, c-Jun, histone H2A.x, a-tubulin, histone H3, alpha tubulin, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial mass, cell cycle arrest, nuclear size, and cell number. A computational model was developed to interpret HCI responses as cell-state trajectories. Results: Analysis of cell-state trajectories showed that 336 chemicals produced tipping points and that HepG2 cells were resilient to the effects of 334 chemicals up to the highest concentration (200 mM) and duration (72 hr) tested. Tipping points were identified as concentration-dependent transitions in system recovery, and the corresponding critical concentrations were generally between 5 and 15 times (25th and 75th percentiles, respectively) lower than the concentration that produced any significant effect on HepG2 cells.

",Computational Modeling and Simulation of Genital Tubercle Development,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Hypospadias is a developmental defect of urethral tube closure that has a complex etiology involving genetic and environmental factors, including anti-androgenic and estrogenic disrupting chemicals, however, little is known about the morphoregulatory consequences of androgen/estrogen balance during genital tubercle (GT) development. Computer models that predictively model sexual dimorphism of the GT may provide a useful resource to translate chemical-target bipartite networks and their developmental consequences across the human-relevant chemical universe. Here, we describe a multicellular agent-based model of genital tubercle (GT) development that simulates urethrogenesis from the sexually-indifferent urethral plate stage to urethral tube closure. The prototype model, constructed in CompuCell3D, recapitulates key aspects of GT morphogenesis controlled by SHH, FGF10, and androgen pathways through modulation of stochastic cell behaviors, including differential adhesion, motility, proliferation, and apoptosis. Proper urethral tube closure in the model was shown to depend quantitatively on SHH- and FGF10-induced effects on mesenchymal proliferation and epithelial apoptosis--both ultimately linked to androgen signaling. In the absence of androgen, GT development was feminized and with partial androgen deficiency, the model resolved with incomplete urethral tube closure, thereby providing an in silico platform for probabilistic prediction of hypospadias risk across combinations of minor perturbations to the GT system at various stages of embryonic development.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Leung , M.C.K., S.

",Evaluation of food-relevant chemicals in the ToxCast high-throughput screening program,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Thousands of chemicals are directly added to or come in contact with food, many of which have undergone little to no toxicological evaluation. The landscape of the food-relevant chemical universe was evaluated using cheminformatics, and subsequently the bioactivity of food-relevant chemicals across the publicly available ToxCast highthroughput screening program was assessed. In total, 8659 food-relevant chemicals were compiled including direct food additives, food contact substances, and pesticides. Of these food-relevant chemicals, 4719 had curated structure definition files amenable to defining chemical fingerprints, which were used to cluster chemicals using a selforganizing map approach. Pesticides, and direct food additives clustered apart from one another with food contact substances generally in between, supporting that these categories not only reflect different uses but also distinct chemistries. Subsequently, 1530 food-relevant chemicals were identified in ToxCast comprising 616 direct food additives, 371 food contact substances, and 543 pesticides. Bioactivity across ToxCast was filtered for cytotoxicity to identify selective chemical effects. Initiating analyses from strictly chemical-based methodology or bioactivity/cytotoxicity-driven evaluation presents unbiased approaches for prioritizing chemicals. Although bioactivity in vitro is not necessarily predictive of adverse effects in vivo, these data provide insight into chemical properties and cellular targets through which foodrelevant chemicals elicit bioactivity.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Karmaus , A., D.

",Predicting_Systemic_Toxicity_Effects_ArchTox_2017_Data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"In an effort to address a major challenge in chemical safety assessment, alternative approaches for characterizing systemic effect levels, a predictive model was developed. Systemic effect levels were curated from ToxRefDB, HESS-DB and COSMOS-DB from numerous study types totaling 4382 in vivo studies for 1201 chemicals. Observed systemic effects in mammalian models are a complex function of chemical dynamics, kinetics, and inter- and intra-individual variability. In order to address the complexity problem, systemic effect levels were modeled at the study-level by leveraging study covariates (e.g., study type, strain, administration route) in addition to multiple descriptor sets, including chemical (ToxPrint, PaDEL, and Physchem), biological (ToxCast), and kinetic descriptors. Using Random Forest modeling with cross-validation and external validation procedures, study-level covariates alone accounted for approximately 20% of the variance reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) from 0.96 log10 mg/kg/day to 0.85 log10 mg/kg/day, providing a baseline performance metric (lower expectation of model performance). A consensus model developed using a combination of study-level covariates, chemical, biological, and kinetic descriptors explained a total of 38% of the variance with an RMSE of 0.76 log10 mg/kg/day. A benchmark model (upper expectation of model performance) was also developed with an RMSE of 0.5 log10 mg/kg/day by incorporating study-level covariates and the mean effect level per chemical. To achieve a representative chemical-level prediction, the minimum study-level predicted and observed effect level per chemical were compared reducing the RMSE from 1.1 to 0.8 log10 mg/kg/day. Although biological descriptors did not improve model performance, the final model was enriched for biological descriptors that indicated xenobiotic metabolism gene expression, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity, demonstrating the importance of accounting for kinetics and non-specific bioactivity in predicting systemic effect levels. Herein, we have generated an externally predictive model of systemic effect levels for use as a safety assessment tool and have generated forward predictions for thousands of chemicals.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Truong, L., G.

",IATA-Bayesian Network Model for Skin Sensitization Data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Since the publication of the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) for skin sensitization, there have been many efforts to develop systematic approaches to integrate the information generated from different key events for decision making. The types of information characterizing key events in an AOP can be generated from in silico, in chemico, in vitro or in vivo approaches. Integration of this information and interpretation for decision making are known as integrated approaches to testing and assessment or IATA. One such IATA that has been developed was published by Jaworska et al (2013) which describes a Bayesian network model known as ITS-2. The current work evaluated the performance of ITS-2 using a stratified cross validation approach. We also characterized the impact of refinements to the network by replacing the most significant component, the output from a commercial expert system TIMES-SS with structural alert information readily generated from the freely available OECD QSAR Toolbox. Lack of any structural alert flags or TIMES-SS predictions, yielded a sensitization potential prediction of 79% +3%/-4%. If the TIMES-SS prediction was replaced by an indicator for the presence of a structural alert, the network predictivity increased to 84% +2%/-4%, which was only slightly less than found for the original network (89% +-2%). The local applicability domain of the original ITS-2 network was also evaluated using reaction mechanistic domains to better understand what types of chemicals ITS-2 was able to make the best predictions for - i.e. a local validity domain analysis. We ultimately found that the original network was successful at predicting which chemicals would be sensitizers, but not at predicting their relative potency.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Fitzpatrick, J., and G.

",Advancing the Adverse Outcome Pathway Concept - An International 'Horizon Scanning' Approach,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Our ability to conduct whole organism toxicity tests to understand chemical safety has been outpaced by our ability to synthesize new chemicals for a wide variety of commercial applications. Therefore, to increase efficiencies in chemical risk assessment, scientists and risk assessors are turning to mechanistic-based studies, making greater use of in vitro and in silico methods, to evaluate potential environmental and human health hazards. A framework that has gained traction for capturing available knowledge describing the linkage between mechanistic data and the apical toxicity endpoints, required for regulatory assessments, is the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). A number of international activities have focused on AOP development and plausible applications to regulatory decision-making. These interactions have prompted dialog between research scientists and regulatory communities to consider how best to use the AOP framework in risk assessment. While expert-facilitated discussions have been instrumental in moving the science of AOPs forward, it was recognized that a survey of the broader scientific community would aid in identifying current limitations while guiding future initiatives for the AOP framework. To that end, a global 'Horizon Scanning' exercise was conducted to solicit questions concerning the challenges or limitations that must be addressed to realize the full potential of the AOP framework in research and regulatory decision making. The majority of questions received fell into several broad topical areas including the concepts of AOP networks and quantitative AOPs, collaboration on and communication of AOP knowledge, AOP discovery and development, chemical and cross-species extrapolation, exposure considerations, and AOP applications. An expert ranking exercise was then conducted to identify the most important questions for each category. These questions were used to develop four broad themes to inform and guide future AOP research and regulatory initiatives. In addition, frequently asked questions (FAQs) were identified and addressed by experts in the field. Answers to FAQs will aid in framing further discussions about common misperceptions about AOPs and allow for clarification of AOP topics. The need for clarification occurred with surprising frequency, indicating that improvements are needed in communicating the AOP framework among the scientific and regulatory communities. Overall, the 'Horizon Scanning' effort brought together the global scientific community to guide the direction of future initiatives and identify key questions surrounding the AOP framework.

The Integrated Ecological Modeling System (IEMS) forecasts water quality and quantity, habitat suitability for aquatic biota, fish biomasses, population densities, productivities, and contamination by methylmercury across headwater watersheds. We applied this IEMS to the Coal River Basin (CRB), West Virginia (USA), an 8-digit hydrologic unit watershed, by simulating a network of 97 stream segments using the SWAT watershed model, a watershed mercury loading model, the WASP water quality model, the PiSCES fish community estimation model, a fish habitat suitability model, the BASS fish community and bioaccumulation model, and an ecoservices post-processer. Model application was facilitated by automated data retrieval and model setup and updated model wrappers and interfaces for data transfers between these models from a prior study. This companion study evaluates baseline predictions of ecoservices provided for 1990-2010 for the population of streams in the CRB and serves as a foundation for future model development.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Johnston , J., C.

",Analysis of the Effects of Cell Stress and Cytotoxicity on In Vitro Assay Activity Across a Diverse Chemical and Assay Space,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Chemical toxicity can arise from disruption of specific biomolecular functions or through more generalized cell stress and cytotoxicity-mediated processes. Here, concentration-dependent responses of 1063 chemicals including pharmaceuticals, natural products, pesticidals, consumer, and industrial chemicals across a diverse battery of 821 in vitro assay endpoints from 7 high-throughput assay technology platforms were analyzed in order to better distinguish between these types of activities. Both cell-based and cell-free assays showed a rapid increase in the frequency of responses at concentrations where cell stress / cytotoxicity responses were observed in cell-based assays. Chemicals that were positive on at least two viability/cytotoxicity assays within the concentration range tested (typically up to 100 M) activated a median of 12% of assay endpoints while those that were not cytotoxic in this concentration range activated 1.3% of the assays endpoints. The results suggest that activity can be broadly divided into: (1) specific biomolecular interactions against one or more targets (e.g., receptors or enzymes) at concentrations below which overt cytotoxicity-associated activity is observed, and (2) activity associated with cell stress or cytotoxicity, which may result from triggering of specific cell stress pathways, chemical reactivity, physico-chemical disruption of proteins or membranes, or broad low-affinity non-covalent interactions. Chemicals showing a greater number of specific biomolecular interactions are generally designed to be bioactive (pharmaceuticals or pesticidal active ingredients), while intentional food-use chemicals tended to show the fewest specific interactions. The analyses presented here provide context for use of these data in ongoing studies to predict in vivo toxicity from chemicals lacking extensive hazard assessment.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Judson , R., K.

",High-throughput screening of chemical effects on steroidogenesis using H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Disruption of steroidogenesis by environmental chemicals can result in altered hormone levels causing adverse reproductive and developmental effects. A high-throughput assay using H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells was used to evaluate the effect of 2060 chemical samples on steroidogenesis via high-performance liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry quantification of 10 steroid hormones, including progestagens, glucocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. The study employed a 3 stage screening strategy. The first stage established the maximum tolerated concentration (MTC, >= 70% viability) per sample. The second stage quantified changes in hormone levels at the MTC whereas the third stage performed concentration-response (CR) on a subset of samples. At all stages, cells were prestimulated with 10 uM forskolin for 48 h to induce steroidogenesis followed by chemical treatment for 48 h. Of the 2060 chemical samples evaluated, 524 samples were selected for 6-point CR screening, based in part on significantly altering at least 4 hormones at the MTC. CR screening identified 232 chemical samples with concentration-dependent effects on 17b-estradiol and/or testosterone, with 411 chemical samples showing an effect on at least one hormone across the steroidogenesis pathway. Clustering of the concentration-dependent chemical-mediated steroid hormone effects grouped chemical samples into 5 distinct profiles generally representing putative mechanisms of action, including CYP17A1 and HSD3B inhibition. A distinct pattern was observed between imidazole and triazole fungicides suggesting potentially distinct mechanisms of action. From a chemical testing and prioritization perspective, this assay platform provides a robust model for high-throughput screening of chemicals for effects on steroidogenesis.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Karmaus , A., C.

",Is Skin penetration a determining factor in skin sensitisation potential and potency? Refuting the notion of a LogKow threshold for Skin Sensitisation,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"t is widely accepted that substances that cannot penetrate through the skin will not be sensitizers. LogKow and molecular weight (MW) have been used to set thresholds for sensitization potential. Highly hydrophilic substances e.g. LogKow <= 1 are expected not to penetrate effectively to induce sensitization. To investigate whether LogKow >1 is a true requirement for sensitization, a large dataset of substances that had been evaluated for their skin sensitization potential under Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of CHemicals (REACH), together with available measured LogKow values was compiled using the OECD eChemPortal. The incidence of sensitizers relative to non-sensitizers above and below a LogKow of 1 was explored. Reaction chemistry principles were used to explain the sensitization observed for the subset of substances with a LogKow <=0. 1482 substances were identified with skin sensitization data and measured LogKow values. 525 substances had a measured LogKow <= 1, 100 of those were sensitizers. There was no significant difference in the incidence of sensitizers above and below a LogKow of 1. Reaction chemistry principles that had been established for lower MW and more hydrophobic substances were found to be still valid in rationalizing the skin sensitizers with a LogKow <= 0. The LogKow threshold arises from the widespread misconception that the ability to efficiently penetrate the stratum corneum is a key determinant of sensitization potential and potency.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Fitzpatrick, J., D.

These damage cost values were then applied to two universities. Annual potential damage costs to human health, agriculture, and natural ecosystems associated with the N footprint of institutions were $11.0 million (2014) at the University of Virginia (UVA) and $3.04 million at the University of New Hampshire (UNH). Costs associated with the release of nitrogen oxides to human health, in particular the use of coal-derived energy, were the largest component of damage at UVA. At UNH the energy N footprint is much lower because of a landfill cogeneration source, and thus the majority of damages were associated with food production. Annual damages associated with release of nitrogen from food production were very similar at the two universities ($1.80 million vs. $1.66 million at UVA and UNH, respectively). These damages also have implications for the extent and scale at which the damages are felt. For example, impacts to human health from energy and transportation are generally larger near the power plants and roads, while impacts from food production can be distant from the campus. Making this information available to institutions and communities can improve their understanding of the damages associated with the different nitrogen forms and sources, and inform decisions about nitrogen reduction strategies.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Compton, J., A.

",Simmons_DeGroot_Metabolism_mRNA_transfection_ApplInVitroTox_Data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The US EPA's ToxCast program is designed to assess chemical perturbations of molecular and cellular endpoints using a variety of high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. However, existing HTS assays have limited or no xenobiotic metabolism which could lead to false positive (chemical is detoxified in vivo) as well as false negative results (chemical is bioactivated in vivo) and thus potential mischaracterization of chemical hazard. We have addressed this challenge by introducing the ten most prevalent human liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes into a human cell line (HEK293T) with low endogenous metabolic capacity. The CYP enzymes were introduced via transfection of modified mRNAs as singlets or as a mixture in relative proportions expressed in the liver. Initial experiments using luminogenic CYP450 substrates demonstrate that cell models express metabolic enzymes from the transfected mRNAs and activities are significantly increased when co-transfected with a CYP accessory protein, P450 oxidoreductase (POR). Transfected HEK293T cells demonstrate the ability to produce predicted metabolites following treatment with well-studied CYP substrates, with metabolite formation occurring through 18 hours post-treatment. As a demonstration of how this method can be used to retrofit existing HTS assays, a proof-of-concept screen for cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells was conducted using 56 test compounds. The results demonstrate that the xenobiotic metabolism conferred by transfection of CYP-encoding mRNAs shifts the dose-response relationship for certain test chemicals such as aflatoxin B1 (bioactivation) and fenazaquin (detoxification). Overall, transfection of CYP-encoding mRNAs is an effective and portable solution for retrofitting metabolic competence to existing cell-based HTS assays.This dataset is associated with the following publication: DeGroot, D., A.

",Changes in gene expression in Arabidopsis in response to nano CeO2 and nano TiO2,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Changes in tissue transcriptomes and productivity of Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated during exposure of plants to two widely used engineered metal oxide nanoparticles, titanium dioxide (nano-titanium) and cerium dioxide (nano-cerium). Microarray analyses confirmed that exposure to either nanoparticle altered the transcriptomes of rosette leaves and roots, with comparatively larger numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found under nano-titania exposure. Nano-titania induced more DEGs in rosette leaves, whereas roots had more DEGs under nano-ceria exposure. MapMan analyses indicated that while nano-titania up-regulated overall metabolism metabolism in both tissues, metabolic processes under nano-ceria remained mostly unchanged. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that both nanoparticles mainly enriched ontology groups such as responses to stress (abiotic and biotic), and defense responses (pathogens), and responses to endogenous stimuli (hormones). Nano-titania specifically induced genes associated with photosynthesis, whereas nano-ceria induced expression of genes related to activating transcription factors, most notably those belonging to the ethylene responsive element binding protein family. Interestingly, there were also increased numbers of rosette leaves and plant biomass under nano-ceria exposure, but not under nano-titania. Other transcriptomic responses did not clearly relate to responses observed at the organism level. This may be due to functional and genomic redundancy in Arabidopsis, which may mask expression of morphological changes, despite discernable responses at the transcriptome level. Additionally, transcriptomic changes often relate with transgenerational phenotypic development, hence it may be productive to direct further experimental work to integrate high-throughput genomic results with longer-term changes in subsequent generations.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Tumburu, L., C.

",Nelms_Evaluating potential refinements to existing Thresholds of Toxicological Concern (TTC) values for environmentally-relevant compounds,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) mandates the US EPA perform risk-based prioritisation of chemicals in commerce and then, for high-priority substances, develop risk evaluations that integrate toxicity data with exposure information. One approach being considered for chemicals with limited chemical-specific toxicity data is a Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC)-to-Exposure ratio. Here, TTC values derived using oral (sub)chronic No Observable (Adverse) Effect Level (NO(A)EL) data from the EPA's Toxicity Values database (ToxValDB) were compared with published TTC values from Munro et al. (1996). 4554 chemicals with structures present in ToxValDB were assigned into their respective TTC categories using the Toxtree software tool. Chemicals were assigned into the five TTC classes (Cramer structural class I, II, III, containing alerts for genotoxicity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). 114 (2.5%) chemicals were determined to be not appropriate for TTC. The TTC values derived from the ToxValDB were similar, but not identical to the Munro TTC values: Cramer I (37.3 compared to 30 ug/kg-day), Cramer II (34.6 compared to 9 ug/kg-day) and Cramer III (3.9 compared to 1.5 ug/kg-day). The 5th percentile values of Cramer classes I and II for the ToxValDB and Munro datasets were not statistically different whereas the class III 5th percentile values were different. Chemical features of the two class III datasets were evaluated to account for the differences in TTC values. The revised Kroes workflow was then applied to a large set of chemicals (~45,000). TTC values derived from this expanded dataset of toxicity values substantiated the original TTC values derived by Munro et al.

In this assay, human-derived cells were labeled with multiple fluorescent probes to visualize various subcellular organelles and structural features. High content image analysis workflows were used to measure hundreds of morphological features at the level of the individual cell (i.e. shape of the cells, intensity, texture and distribution of fluorescent labels, etc.). The resultant data were then used to calculate well-level summary values, perform high-throughput concentration-response modeling and generate phenotypic response profiles. First, we identified and screened a set of candidate phenotypic reference chemicals for use as plate-based controls for evaluating HTPP assay performance during large-scale screening studies and identified an optimal exposure duration for HTPP screening. Second, we screened a set of 462 environmental chemicals in the U-2 OS cell model and derived in vitro potency estimates for bioactivity of all active chemicals. In addition, we demonstrated the technical reproducibility of the HTPP assay in concentration-response screening mode using the previously identified phenotypic reference chemicals. Next, we used reverse dosimetry to calculate administered equivalent doses (AEDs) corresponding to the thresholds for chemical bioactivity and compared those values to in vivo effect values from mammalian toxicity studies.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Nyffeler, J., C.

",Computational Model of Secondary Palate Fusion and Disruption ChemResTox Data,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Morphogenetic events are driven by cell-generated physical forces and complex cellular dynamics. To improve our capacity to predict developmental effects from cellular alterations, we built a multi-cellular agent-based model in CompuCell3D that recapitulates the cellular networks and collective cell behavior underlying growth and fusion of the mammalian secondary palate. The model incorporated multiple signaling pathways (TGF?, BMP, FGF, EGF, SHH) in a biological framework to recapitulate morphogenetic events from palatal outgrowth through midline fusion. It effectively simulated higher-level phenotypes (e.g., midline contact, medial edge seam (MES) breakdown, mesenchymal confluence, fusion defects) in response to genetic or environmental perturbations. Perturbation analysis of various control features revealed model functionality with respect to cell signaling systems and feedback loops for growth and fusion, diverse individual cell behaviors and collective cellular behavior leading to physical contact and midline fusion, and quantitative analysis of the TGF/EGF switch that controls MES breakdown - a key event in morphogenetic fusion. The virtual palate model was then executed with theoretical chemical perturbation scenarios to simulate switch behavior leading to a disruption of fusion following chronic (e.g., dioxin) and acute (e.g., retinoic acid, hydrocortisone) toxicant exposures. This computer model adds to similar systems models toward a 'virtual embryo' for simulation and quantitative prediction of adverse developmental outcomes following genetic perturbation and/or environmental.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Hutson, S., M.

",Anthropogenic enhancements to production of highly oxygenated molecules from autoxidation,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Atmospheric oxidation of natural and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) leads to secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which constitutes a major and often dominant component of atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Recent work demonstrates that rapid autoxidation of organic peroxy radicals (RO2) formed during VOC oxidation results in highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOM) which efficiently form SOA. As NOx emissions decrease, the chemical regime of the atmosphere changes to one in which RO2 autoxidation becomes increasingly important, potentially increasing PM2.5, while oxidant availability driving RO2 formation rates simultaneously declines, possibly slowing regional PM2.5 formation. Using a unique suite of in situ aircraft observations and laboratory studies of HOM, together with a detailed molecular mechanism, we show that although autoxidation in an archetypal biogenic VOC system becomes more competitive as NOx decreases, absolute HOM production rates decrease due to oxidant reductions, leading to an overall positive coupling between anthropogenic NOx and localized biogenic SOA from autoxidation. This effect is observed in the Atlanta, Georgia urban plume where HOM is enhanced in the presence of elevated NO, and predictions for Guangzhou, China, where increasing HOM-RO2 production coincides with increases in NO from 1990 to 2010. These results suggest added benefits to PM2.5 abatement strategies come with NOx emission reductions and have implications for aerosol-climate interactions due to changes in global SOA resulting from NOx interactions since the pre-industrial era.Datasets include links to CMAQ, F0AM, and WAM model code as well as the SENEX aircraft campaign data archive.Files include data shown in Figure 3 (C10H18O7 HOM from SENEX), data used to construct Figure 4 and S10 (CMAQ model predictions of oxidants and intermediate species), additional supporting data in Figure S11 (SENEX C10 HOM species), and observed particle and gas composition from SOAFFEE laboratory experiments (Figure S6 and elsewhere).This dataset is associated with the following publication: Pye, H., E.

",Phenotypic Profiling of Reference Chemicals across Biologically Diverse Cell Types Using the Cell Painting Assay,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Cell Painting is a high-throughput, phenotypic profiling assay that uses fluorescent cytochemistry o visualize a variety of organelles and high-content imaging to derive a large number of morphological features at the single cell level. Here, we used the Cell Painting assay to characterize the phenotypic effects of sixteen phenotypic reference chemicals in concentration- response screening mode across six biologically diverse human-derived cell lines (U-2 OS, MCF7, HepG2, A549, HTB-9, ARPE-19). All cell lines were labeled using the same cytochemistry protocol and the same set of phenotypic features were calculated. We found it necessary to optimize image acquisition settings and cell segmentation parameters for each cell type but did not adjust the cytochemistry protocol. For some reference chemicals, similar subsets of phenotypic features corresponding to a particular organelle were associated with the highest effect magnitudes in each affected cell type. Overall, for certain chemicals the Cell Painting assay yielded qualitatively similar biological activity profiles across a group of diverse, morphologically distinct human-derived cell lines without the requirement for cell-type specific optimization of cytochemistry protocols.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Willis, C., J.

Prior to this report, there was very limited information addressing the ex vivo metabolism of THI by fish species and the metabolic pathways regulating its potential adverse effects. The in vitro and ex vivo biotransformation pathway of THI is defined by the formation of three primary metabolites (TM1, TM2 and TM3) via separate paths differentiated by reductive decyanation, reductive dechlorination with hydration and dealkylation processes, respectively. Kinetic rates were calculated for the rat microsomal decyanation of THI into TM1 (Km=299.2 uM and Vmax=5.3 pmol/min/mg), and for the dealkylation of THI into TM3 (Km=368.9 uM uM and Vmax=3.95 pmol/min/mg). Formation confirmation and identity inference of THI metabolites in absence of standards was achieved by LC-UV and High Resolution-MS strategies. It was concluded that the in vitro and ex vivo metabolic products of THI are conserved both across species (rat and RBT) and levels of biological organization (microsomes and liver slices), as previously reported for the neonicotinoid insecticides Imidacloprid and Acetamiprid.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Serrano, J., R.

We selected 14 chemicals based on their risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and tested them in hepatocytes at two treatment concentrations. HTTr data was generated using the TempO-Seq whole transcriptome and S1500+ assays. The HTTr platform exhibited high reproducibility between technical replicates (r>0.9) but biological replication was greater for TempO-Seq S1500+ (r>0.85) than for the whole transcriptome (r>0.7). Reproducibility between biological replicates was dependent on the strength of transcriptional effects induced by a chemical treatment. Despite targeting a smaller number of genes, the S1500+ assay clustered chemical treatments and produced gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) scores comparable to those of the whole transcriptome. Connectivity mapping showed a high-level of reproducibility between TempO-Seq data and Affymetrix GeneChip data from the Open TG-GATES project with high concordance between the S1500+ gene set and whole transcriptome. Taken together, our results provide guidance on selecting the number of technical and biological replicates and support the use of TempO-Seq S1500+ assay for a high-throughput platform for screening hepatotoxicants.

These include the transects included in the Canadian Tar Sands study. A brief description of TES is listed below.TES is a spectrometer that measures the infrared-light energy (radiance) emitted by Earth's surface and by gases and particles in Earth's atmosphere. Every substance warmer than absolute zero emits infrared radiation at certain signature wavelengths. Spectrometers measure this radiation as a means of identifying the substances.TES has very high spectral resolution, which gives it the ability to pinpoint the wavelengths at which the substances are emitting. This enables precise identification of the substances, and also provides information about their location in the atmosphere. Emission wavelengths can vary with temperature and pressure, so seeing the emissions with great precision enables scientists to infer the temperature and pressure of the chemicals from which they came. This, in turn, implies that the chemicals being observed are at a certain altitude where those temperatures and pressures apply. The ability to determine the altitude of the observed chemicals enables TES to distinguish radiation from the upper and lower atmosphere, and focus on the lower layer - the troposphere.Since it observes light in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum, similar to night-vision goggles, TES can observe both day and night. Its spectral range overlaps that of HIRDLS, another of the instruments aboard the Aura satellite. So, in addition to its work in the troposphere, TES can supplement HIRDLS measurements of chemicals in the stratosphere that are common to both instruments, as well as help scientists measure additional constituents of the stratosphere.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Shephard, , M.W., C.

",Systematically evaluating read-across prediction and performance using a local validity approach characterized by chemical structure and bioactivity information,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"Read-across is a popular data gap filling technique within category and analogue approaches for regulatory purposes. Acceptance of read-across remains an ongoing challenge with several efforts underway for identifying and addressing uncertainties. Here we demonstrate an algorithmic, automated approach to evaluate the utility of using in vitro bioactivity data (""bioactivity descriptors"", from EPA's ToxCast program) in conjunction with chemical descriptor information to derive local validity domains (specific sets of nearest neighbors) to facilitate read-across for a number of in vivo repeated dose toxicity study types. Over 3400 different chemical structure descriptors were generated for a set of 976 chemicals and supplemented with the outcomes from 821 in vitro assays. The read-across prediction for a given chemical was based on the similarity weighted endpoint outcomes of its nearest neighbors. The approach enabled a performance baseline for read-across predictions of specific study outcomes to be established. Bioactivity descriptors were often found to be more predictive of in vivo toxicity outcomes than chemical descriptors or a combination of both. This generic read across (GenRA) is intended to form a first step in systemizing read-across prediction and serves as a useful tool as part of a screening level hazard assessment for new untested chemicals.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Shah , I., J.

Since digester effluents are used as for cropland applications, we are interested to find out whether the quality of these organic fertilizers are impacted by the AD process. In addition, few studies have investigated the performance of AD in field conditions. In this study, we monitored the performance of three operational AD systems for two years. These three systems have different retention times (9, 12 and 34 days), that is how long the waste materials stay in the digester. We collected influent and effluent samples every two months and analyzed for pH, nutrients and metals. We found that the two shorter retention systems slightly decreased effluent pH while the long retention system significantly increased the effluent pH, i.e., by 1.8 unit. The 34-day retention system also removed more solids and increased ammonium-nitrogen in the effluent. We found no significant changes in the metals that we analyzed. These findings can assist in developing strategies for cleaner production using AD in an environmentally sustainable manner.This dataset is associated with the following publication: Zhang, X., I.

Annual mean drinking water arsenic concentrations from 2000 to 2010 were available for a total of 87,662 samples from 75,453 CWS from 26 states, representing 1,425 counties. For samples identified as non-detects, the most frequently reported values were 0.5 ppb and 1 ppb, with a range of 0 ppb to 10 ppb. For non-detect samples reported as zero, the value was substituted with a constant of 0.25 ppb (Almberg et al., 2017, Bulka et al., 2016). Of the samples that were reported as non-detects, 10.87% were reported as zeros.Cancer Data: County-level cancer counts and incidence rates for bladder, colorectal, and kidney cancers were acquired from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and CDC's State Cancer Profiles for 2011 through 2015 for adults (age >= 50) to match the counties with exposure data (National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018a). We utilized the time period 2011-2015 to provide a lag following the exposure period of 2000-2010. The State Cancer Profiles provide age-adjusted county-level cancer incidence, prevalence, mortality rates and average annual counts for 20 different types of cancers and select demographics (National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018b).

",Cyanobacterial frequency at drinking water intakes,U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD),"This study presents the first large-scale assessment of cyanobacterial frequency and abundance at surface drinking water intakes across the United States. Public water systems serve drinking water to nearly 90% of the United States population. Cyanobacteria and their toxins may degrade the quality of finished drinking water and can lead to negative health consequences. Satellite imagery can serve as a cost-effective and consistent monitoring technique for surface cyanobacterial blooms in source waters and can provide drinking water treatment operators information for managing their systems. This study uses satellite imagery from the European Space Agency's Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) spanning June 2016 through April 2020. At 300-m spatial resolution, OLCI imagery can be used to monitor cyanobacteria in 685 drinking water sources across 285 lakes in 44 states. First, a subset of satellite data was compared to a subset of 99 responses submitted as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's fourth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 4). These UCMR 4 quantitative responses included visual observations of algal bloom presence and absence near drinking water intakes from March 2018 through November 2019. Overall agreement between satellite imagery and UCMR 4 qualitative responses was high at over 94% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.70. Next, temporal frequency of cyanobacterial blooms at all resolvable drinking water sources was assessed. In 2019, bloom frequency averaged 2% and peaked at 100%, where 100% indicated a bloom was always present at the source waters when satellite imagery was available. Monthly cyanobacterial abundances were used to assess short-term trends across all resolvable drinking water sources. Generally, 2016-2020 was an insufficient time period for observing changes at these source waters, On average, a decade of data would be required for observed trends to outweigh variability in the data. However, five source waters did demonstrate a sustained short-term trend, with one increasing in cyanobacterial abundance from June 2016 to April 2020 and four decreasing.
